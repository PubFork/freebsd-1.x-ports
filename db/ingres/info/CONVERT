The new ingres version 8 system has a number of changes and enhancments
over the version 7 system. However, the databases that were made with
the old system are NOT compatible with the new system. However, there
exists a program that will convert version 7 databases into version 8
databases. You will need your 4.2 binaries to use the conversion
utility. You should have moved your old bin directory to bin7 before
this distribution tape was loaded. If not you will have to restore
those binaries from your system dumps. Once the bin7 directory is in
place, you should check that all the 'proctab7' files in the files
directory has the line:
DB:$P/bin
changed to
DB:$P/bin7

The system administrator should then do the following to convert all
the databases.

% su ingres
% cd ~ingres/data/base
% mv READ_ME .READ_ME
% foreach j (*)
 ? ~ingres/bin/ingconv -s $j
 ?end
% mv .READ_ME READ_ME

That will convert all the normal databases on a machine.  However,
ingconv does not work with indirect files. It is suggested you change
them into symbolic links before running ingconv on them. If you don't
know what an indirect file is, you probably aren't using them.
