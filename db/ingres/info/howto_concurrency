           Instructions for installing the INGRES lock device in UNIX

                                  May 19, 1983



        INGRES  version  8.1  has a fully implemented concurrency control
        mechanism.  The INGRES system sets and clears locks by writing to
        a  server named "ingreslock".  If the socket cannot be opened for
        writing, INGRES runs without any concurrency control.

        Initially it is advisable to bring up INGRES without the  concur-
        rency  device.   If  planned  usage of the INGRES system requires
        concurrency control then the  server  "ingreslock"  must  be  in-
        stalled into your UNIX system.

        This  document  describes  the  procedure for installing the UNIX
        server for "ingreslock".


        1.  Log in as root.

        2.  Compiling the concurrency device


            2.1.  change directory to ../source/support

                The  concurrency  device   consists   of   three   files:
                .../source/support/ildr.c
                 .../source/h/ildr.h and .../source/support/init_socket.c

                compile the lock driver
                     make ingreslock


            2.2.  Installation Parameters

                There are several parameters in ildr.h that can be set by
                the user.  These include:

                     NLOCKS - number of locks
                     PLOCKS - page locks
                     RLOCKS - relation locks
                     DLOCKS - data base locks

                NLOCKS  is  the  maximum number of locks permissible.  It
                determines the size of the lock  table.   PLOCKS  is  the
                maximum  number  of  page,  relation and data base locks.
                RLOCKS is the maximum number of relation  and  data  base
                locks.   DLOCKS is the maximum number of data base locks.
                Only DLOCKS INGRESes can be active at one time.

                The following conditions must  hold  to  protect  against
                deadlock due to lock table overflow:

                     NLOCKS > PLOCKS > RLOCKS > DLOCKS + 6

                The  extra  number  of  RLOCKS are required inorder to be
                able to run 6-variable queries.  We recommend first  set-
                ting DLOCKS and then setting the other parameters as fol-
                lows:

                     RLOCKS = 2*DLOCKS + 6
                     PLOCKS = RLOCKS + 3
                     NLOCKS = PLOCKS + 1

                For example, to reduce the size of the  lock  table,  one
                could  set DLOCKS = 2, RLOCKS = 10, PLOCKS = 13, NLOCKS =
                14.  In this case, only 2 people could be running  ingres
                at one time.

                As  another  example, to allow for more concurrent INGRE-
                Ses, one could set DLOCKS = 20, RLOCKS = 46, PLOCKS = 49,
                NLOCKS = 50.  This scenario would allow for twenty simul-
                taneous INGRES users.


            2.3.  Copy the server

                Copy the lock server to where the  servers  are  kept  on
                your system.

                     cp ingreslock  /etc/ingreslock


        3.  Add the service to /etc/services

            You should have an entry


                 ingreslock     1524/tcp       # Ingres concurrency driver



            In  your  /etc/services  file.  Note that the number (in this
            case 1524) need only be unique among your servers,  and  does
            NOT have to be 1524 (we use it though).

        4.  Put lock server in /etc/rc.local thusly:

                 /etc/ingreslock & echo -n ' ingreslock' > /dev/console


            This  ensures that the lock server is always running when the
            system is up.

        5.  Done.

            INGRES will now use the "ingreslock" service for its  concur-
            rency control.  A simple way to verify this is to try running
            (for example) "purge" on a data base while anyone is  running
