PROLOGUE

I FEEL LIKE APOLOGIZING for the delay of the new release. I just did
not have the time to make the final things. Now it's done, and I try
to get it out as soon as possible. Since I moved to another city, it
will take another time until my network link is restored, that's why
questions aren't likely to be responded too quickly. Sorry for that
too.


NEW THINGS

Just a few days after release of the TeX 0.1a upgrading pack I got
dvips and ghostscript to work together, it was easy and I was happy.
Moreover I got a newer version of TeX3.14 release from Washington.
But in spite of posting an upgrading archive then, I decided to make
an extensive reorganization of the whole buch of stuff related to TeX.
Inspired by the way that TeX3.14 is organized I worked on the Makefile
and it's quite good now. The idea is to have a single point of change
in order to have the change take effect in any package installed with
this method.  


NEW ORGANIZATION

To be more clear: We alway had to configure a makefile, telling it
where to put binaries, manpages and what is especialy nasty with TeX,
tell it where all the mf- and tex-inputs, formats, bases, fonts tfms
and pks pxls for all different sizes go. Then if we wanted to change
the organization of the TeX library, we had to change every single
Makefile for TeX, the dvidrivers and whatever else is installed. Then
how can we easily cange default devices? Since I do not have a
laserjet and no 400dpi printer, I don't want to have the default
resolution of dvips to be 400dpi and of xdvi to be 300dpi and
whatever. But there are people who already replaced their 240dpi thing
by a laserjet and they do not 240dpi to be the default. So what do we
do? Either write 60 screen pages full of instructions how to make the
changess in again every single Makefile and script, or: Let make and
set have it done for you!

NOW things will become much easier. We define symbols and export them
to the Makefile of each package, which can use it to define its flags
or defaults. Now any new package added to TeX & friends will be
configured only once; with symbolic names rather than actual values.
Either make itself or a simple sed-script will fill in the actual
values for us. Now the only Makefile the normal TeX user has to care
about, is the overall Makefile.


MORE NEW THINGS

Beside that, it was necessary to implement a user's privat TeX library
tree along with the systems TeX lib. By default any user who wants to
participate in the (though infomal) TeX user group, will have a
library tree called TeX rooted in his home directory. This is where
all his macros and fonts and texts should go because they are found
here. Nobody has to care about seting up his environment variables if
he just want to go ahead with what comes by default. Shell scripts are
made automaticaly, definig the environment and must only be included
in the .profile or .cshrc.

Then several people have asked whether it ws possible to make TeX
easier to use. TeXperts, newbees and people who just don't care, they
all can be happy now, since we have two scripts now which act as front
ends. Homogenizing and simplifying a lot: mftopk and dvidr.


EASY FONT GENERATION

Mftopk is the very easy to use and very flexible font generator which
does all the necessary calls of mf, gftopk and, what is most
important, figure out the correct parameters. All you have to tell
mftopk is, which font you like, for what device you like it and by
what magnification.  That's all. If it is more complicated, then it's
a bug and has to be complaint about and fixed.


EASY OUTPUT GENERATION

Dvidr is one homogenious dvidriver, which calls dvips, the beebe
drivers, the previewer, and whatever we add to it to be called. There
are two method's of printing tex output and two of previewing it. As
you might know, I complaint about the beebe drivers, they are too hard
to maintain, and fixing the rounding errors is too nasty. However,
there is an other way that is somwhat less easy to go, but at least I
am much more happy with the results: Dvips and GhostScript work nicely
together, producing beautiful output. And the latter method has a big
advantage which will become even more importend in the Future: Type1
fonts are now easily used with TeX. It seems to me that our lovely
META cat will get jealous, because her TeX Lion will go out which
Adobeia tonight. Type one fonts are much more, and they are more
flexible. METAFONT is still good, and it would be even better, if it
learned to produce Type1 code, rather than bitmaps.

Unfortunately my net link was so bad, that I couldn't get the afm
files I wanted, and so I still did not automatize the afm2tfm way as
it could be. But i do not wait any longer, since my time will become
even less in the nearer future.


WHAT IS INCLUDED

The contents of this TeX release for a short overview:

- TeX3.14	(alias "unixtex" see below)
- dvips-5.515	the dvi to post script driver
- xdvi		dvi a previewer for X11
- beebe		the old beebe dvi printer driver set
- dvi2tty	nice little tty driver and dvi file disassembler
- mftopk	easy font generator
- dvidr		easy dvi driver


NOTES ABOUT TeX3.14

I made a lot of changes to TeX3.14, I should have renamed it. TeX3.14
as I got it from an ftp server is too big, contains too much of stuff,
that is not experimental, not working, or rarely used. Then the
computer modern font sources where missing. I added them, I updated
the LaTeX package and I cleaned up the tree. There is a directory
called inputs, which contains latex under tex. This is because I think
that latex is a macro package as any other macro packages too. There
are still problems with bibtex. In the inputs subdirectory you will
find some other gimmics, which you can play with, they might be
deleted in the next release. I do not want TeX for 386BSD to grow to
big. I like to see our TeX as a basic thing, improved in simplicity
and easy functionality rather than in diversity. It is easy to get a
macro package from a TeX server and get it installed on this basis.


VERSION MESS

Sorry again, and again due to the bad network link, I could not diff
the packages contained here completely against the originals. This is
not nice, since you won't have neither TeX3.14, nor dvips-5.515 here,
but you have modified versions. I will restore the integrity next
time, until then you should be careful in two terms. (1) don't
redistribute any of those packages on it's on. (2) be careful in
replacing a package by a newer version. Since it should have to be
pathced with the TeX for 386BSD stuff to work correctly here. This
applies especialy for dvips. Fortunately I was able to make diffs
contained in the ./scripts directory. But TeX3.14 is changed too and
the diff included herein is the old one of release 0.1


INSTALLATION

Of course there are two ways: source and binary. Now these both are
distributed seperately, to make saving of disk space and network load
easier.

TeX01.5.tar.Z		is the source archive while,
TeX01.5.bin.tar.Z	is the binary archive.

However, I stronly recommend to make the system from source, since you
cannot make profit of the easy configuration facility otherwise.

INSTALLATION OF BINARIES

To install the binaries unpack the archive and move TeX01.5/lib/TeX to
/usr/local/lib/TeX. Thus your old /usr/local/lib/{tex,mf} won't be
overwritten. Be careful with deleting those trees, because you may
have added some own work there which should be moved into the new tree
first! Move the contents of TeX01.5/bin into /usr/local/bin and
TeX01.5/man/{cat1,man1} respectively.

From now on you add new tex users by moving the contents of
/usr/local/lib/TeX/usr into your home directory. These are 4 files:

  -rw-r--r--   1 gunther  tex            27 May 18 16:59 .Xdefaults-plocus
  drwxr-xr-x   8 gunther  tex           512 May 18 16:59 TeX
  -rw-r--r--   1 gunther  tex           739 May 18 16:59 texsetup.csh
  -rw-r--r--   1 gunther  tex           876 May 18 16:59 texsetup.sh

You better rename .Xdefaults-plocus in /usr/local/lib/TeX/usr first,
to fit your site.

% mv .Xdefaults-plocus .Xdefaults `hostname`

then copy the whole bunch by

% cp -R * ~

back home, include either texsetup.csh or texsetup.sh into your .cshrc
resp. .profile. Log out and relog in, to make the .profile settings
active. You can start TeXing now.

Since you did not make use of the easy configuration facility, you
must configure the following files manualy:

bin/mftopk
bin/dvidr
lib/TeX/ps/config.ps
lib/TeX/mf/inputs/modes.mf
lib/TeX/usr

Delete the beebe drivers you do not need.
bin/dvixxx


SOME WORDS ABOUT THE LIBRARY

The library is rooted now in one single directory named TeX. This is
more logical than having tex and mf separately and tex/fonts contain
the fonts, since fonts belongs to both tex and mf.

TeX/		Root of the TeX & friends library
TeX/tex/		TeX's own stuff
TeX/tex/inputs/		  macros (*.tex and *.sty files)
TeX/tex/formats/	  *.fmt files
TeX/mf/			METAFONT's own stuff
TeX/mf/inputs/		  mf programs, fonts (*.mf files)
TeX/mf/bases/		  *.base files
TeX/ps/			PS stuff (most of it from dvips)
TeX/dvi/		DVI stuff (rarely used)
TeX/fonts/		FONTS
TeX/fonts/tfm/		  font metrics (*.tfm files)
TeX/fonts/pk/		  font binaries (*.pk files)
TeX/fonts/vf/		  virtual fonts (*.vf files), for Type1 fonts
TeX/bibtex/		BibTeX stuff (still unusable)

The `inputs' and `fonts'-sub- directories may contain subdirectories,
for example you'll find the Computer Modern fonts in TeX/mf/inputs/cm.
This is useful in order to keep things well arranged.


INSTALLATION FROM SOURCES

Unpack the archive and cd to TeX01.5 and see the Makefile. Everything
should be explained there. Make your setup to fit your system and type

% make

this should do it all. Except make will stop at one point in making
dvips. Don't worry, just type

% make

again, and things will end up correctly. After successful make type

% make install

This installs everything including man pages, which you still have to
nroff. Of course you have to be root to install things, but you even
have to be root to make them, since the library will be installed
first. The rest is explained in INSTALLING BINARIES.

You don't have to configure anything but dvidr. Since dvidr brings
together different programs with different philosopies how things
should get done, and since it must fit your actual printer devices,
there is no reasonable way to do this automaticaly. See the dvidr
script *after* installation. Everything should be explained there.


SEE THE MANUAL files and the TeXbook for more.
