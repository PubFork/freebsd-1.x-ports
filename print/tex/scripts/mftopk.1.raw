.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI \-d device

.BI \-f

.BI \-m mag

.I fontnames ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
For \fITeX\fP newcomers it is often hard to get used to all the different
file types, and even for people who have been using \fITeX\fP for some time,
it is not trivial to call \fImf\fP properly in order to build new font
binaries.
.PP
\fImftopk\fP is an easy to use utility to make compressed font binaries
(*.pk) from \fIMETAFONT\fP source files (*.mf).
.PP
You just give a device name, the magnification and the fontnames you
want to build as parameters to \fImftopk\fP. A fontname is the basename part
of a \fIMETAFONT\fP source filename it is not the filename itself. It makes
no sense to specify a path before the fontname. If you want to make
new fonts please move the *.mf files to a place like
$(MFINPUTS_USER_386BSD) or wherelse \fImf\fP will find it. Of
course, this can be the current directory `.' if the MFINPUTS
environment variable includes it.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.BI -d mode
Set the name of the \fIMETAFONT\fP mode, which defines the fontmaking for an
actual device (such as resolution, aspect ratio, etc). If you do not
know the proper mode name, let \fImftopk\fP print you a list of all valid
names. This can be done by giving `\fIhelp\fP' as the mode name.
.TP
.BI -m magnification

Set the magnification factor. The default is 1. You can give any
magnification term, that you could also set mag to in \fIMETAFONT\fP i.e.
either a simple factor (e.g. `-m2' for two fold size) or a `magstep'
term (e.g. `\-m"magstep 3"' for a 1.2^3 fold size). If the term contains
spaces enclose it in double qoute marks to protect it from being
broken up.
.TP
.BI -f
force remake of fonts. Normally \fImftopk\fP tries to check for an existing
*.pk file for the font beeing made, and skips that font if it finds
one. With the -f option any font is made whether it's *.pk exists or
not.
