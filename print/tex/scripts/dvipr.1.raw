.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
For
.I TeX
newcomers it is often hard to get used to all the different
file types, and even for people who have been using
.I TeX
for some time,
it is not trivial to call
.I mf
properly in order to build new font binaries.

.P 
\fIMftopk\fP is an easy to use utility to make compressed font
binaries (*.pk) from \fIMETAFONT\fP source files (*.mf).

You just give a device name, the magnification and the fontnames you
want to build as parameters to mftopk. A fontname is the basename part
of a METAFONT source filename it is not the filename itself. It makes
no sense to specify a path before the fontname. If you want to make
new fonts please move the *.mf files to a place like
$(MFINPUTS_USER_386BSD) or wherelse \fImf\fP will find it first.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The 
.I -d
option must be given. If you do not know the proper device
name, let mftopk print you a list of all valid device names. This can
be done by giving "\fI-dD help\fP"
as the device name.
.P
The 
.I magnification
is set by the
.I -m 
option. If you don't give a -m
option the magnification used will be 1. You can give any
magnification term, that you could also set mag to in METAFONT i.e. either a
simple factor (e.g. "\fI-m 2\fP" for two fold size) or a "magstep" term
(e.g. "\fI-m magstep3\fP" for a 1.2**3 fold size).
.P
Finally there is the \fI-f\fP option, it tells mftopk to remake any
preexistent font. Normally mftopk tries to check for an existing *.pk
file for the font beeing made, and skips that font. With the -f option
any font is made whether it's *.pk exists or not.
