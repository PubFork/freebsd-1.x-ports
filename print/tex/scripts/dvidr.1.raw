.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIdvidr\fP is a front end dvi driver. Since every dvi driver has basically
the same functionality but uses different syntax and option names,
there is the need of one unique front end which provides the same
command and option syntax for any driver and previewer for which it is
configured.
.PP
Since \fIdvidr\fP is a shell script it can be reconfigured easily. In fact,
you or your sytem administrator must configure at least some
parameters if \fIdvidr\fP is installed the first time, since it doesn't know
about your printer device and how it behaves.

.SH USAGE AND OPTIONS
.LP
The last parameter to \fIdvidr\fP must be a dvi-file usually named `*.dvi',
however you need not append the `.dvi'. Since this is a feature
commonly supported by the dvi driver programs and not by \fIdvidr\fP itself,
it is safe to write out the `.dvi'.
.PP
There are three types of options:
.PP
1. mode and driver selection options
.PP
2. driver control options
.PP
3. auxiliary  options, which are simply passed on.

.SH 1. MODE AND DRIVER SELECTION
.LP
General mode options are
.TP
.B \-v
preview
.TP
.B \-p
print
.LP
.TP
.B \-n	
produces no output at all but is used for its side effects.
\FIdvips\FP($(MANEXT_386BSD)), the postscript dvi driver has the capability of
figuring out what fonts are needed by a document and if any of them must
be created before printing. It then executes commands to make the
missing fonts. See mftopk($(MANEXT_386BSD)) for this.

Currently there are three driver programs installed:

.TP
.B \-G
use \fIdvips\fP($(MANEXT_386BSD)) piping the output to GhostScript.
.TP
.B \-B
use the Beebe dvi drivers \fIdvixxx\fP($(MANEXT_386BSD)).
.TP
.B \-X
use the xdvi($(MANEXT_386BSD)) previewer.

The following table summarizes mode and driver options along with the
associated action:

.SH 2. DRIVER CONTROL OPTIONS
currently there are the following driver control options available.

.TP
.BI \-d device
Set a device name. This option does slightly different
things when used with different drivers. With -G it sets the device
for GhostScript. With -B it sets the actual Beebe driver to use, that
is the `xxx' in \fIdvixxx\fP($(MANEXT_386BSD)). With the -n option this sets
the mode for which mftopk($(MANEXT_386BSD)) shall create the fonts.
There is currently no use for this option with -X.
.TP
.BI \-o filename
If you want to have your output sent to a file rather than to the
actual printer, use this option.
.TP
.BI \-x offset
Set the horizontal page offset. \fIOffset\fP is a decimal number which can be
negative or float. \FIdvidr\FP currently supports no units, so any distances
given here are in inches.
.TP
.BI \-y offset
Set the vertical page offset. See -x for more.

.SH AUXILIARY OPTIONS
Sometimes you have to pass options on to the actual dvi driver program
in order to make settings not provided by the \fIdvidr\fP interface. If you
have to set lots of options here, think about bypassing \fIdvidr\fP and call
your driver program directly.
.TP
.B \-\-
Pass all following options to the actual driver program. Remember that
the last word will be interpreted as the dvifile. This interpretation
takes precedence over any atempt of an parameter option to take the
last word for itself. In fact there is no use to call \fIdvidr\fP without a
dvi file.

.SH BUGS
.LP
This script is somewhat hacked, so there may be errors or
inconsistencies. Some more commonly used options should be
under control of \fIdvidr\fP, to minimize the need of auxiliary options.
