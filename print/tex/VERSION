TeX 3.14 (386BSD 01.5pl1 release)

Note: This version has been hacked heavily by Nate Williams.  I removed
some device independant functinoality to gain a more standard setup, which
allows xdvi and dvips to work as stand-alone utilities which don't require
any other driv.  This is necessary for such packages as Auc-TeX, and for
those folks who are already used to using TeX.  It also removes the necessity
for a per-user TeX directory.  ffr

The changes involved replacing dvips and xdvi with stock versions which
build fonts on the fly and, and changing the makefiles in the overall TeX 
distribution to no longer do the Makefile and setup in those directories.

There is a slight security problem with this setup, as any user can write
to the global font directory, but in general this is okay, since most
machines are single-user, or those users will be safe (since the only
thing to be gained by writing bad fonts would be corrupted fonts in the 
output files and nothing else)
