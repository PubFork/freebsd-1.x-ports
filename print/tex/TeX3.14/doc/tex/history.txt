This file contains a reverse-chronological listing of the various
releases of TeX.  This should help you install any new system you get
on an updated distribution tape, because it identifies which files
changed since the last distribution you received.

7-April-85 Version 1.3.  Minor obscure bug fixes here and there.
 Important changes to PLAIN.TEX that should only affect a few users.
 Added BIBTeX, plus up-to-date LaTeX.  Metafont is starting to settle
 down, version .81 on tape.  Don't ask what happened to 1.2.

9-July-84 Version 1.1.  Minor obscure bug fixes here and there.  DVITYPE does
 positition rounding better.  LaTeX version 2.06 on distribution tape.  First
 crack at HPTEX is also on tape.  Second printing (with corrections) of the
 TeXbook is at the publisher.

3-December-83 Version 1.0!  First copy of TeXbook now at Stanford!

Below are the pre-1.0 releases of TeX.  Please keep in mind the fact
that the system was still under development during this period!

17-September-83 Version .999999?  TEXINFO is now FONTDIMEN.  WEBHDR is now
 WEBMAC.  MANHDR is now MANMAC.  \newswitch is now \newif.  The word
 "module" has been changed in most places to "section", and "ascii"
 to "ASCII".  Small DVITYPE bug fixed.  New AmSTEX.

32-July-83 Version 0.9999 of TeX, 2.2 of Weave (small bug fixes).
 Updated Plain (forgot last time).  TeXMAN matches the July 32 printing.

26-July-83 Version 0.999 of TeX, 2.0 of everything else.  New RED manuals.

2-July-83 Version 0.99 of TeX.  New change file format.  New PATGEN
program, for hyphenation.

30-May-83 Version 0.98 of TeX.  Since \setcount is now called \count,
all of the programs changed, none but TeX and DVItype significantly.

16-April-83  Version 0.97 of TeX.  Small fixes to other programs.

20-Mar-83  Version 0.96 of TeX.  A few bug fixes and new features.  Small
changes to Weave, Tangle, PLtoTF.

8-Feb-83  Version 0.95 of TeX.  A few bug fixes.  In WRITE stmts, :0 has been
replaced with :1 to fit the ANSII standard.  Many discrectionary hyphens (\-)
have been removed from the Web sources (TeX82 is much better at hyphenation,
so they're not needed), so check your change files.  A number of control
sequences have been renamed (see \newname in PLAIN.TEX), too.  `History'
variables have been added to many of the programs, suitable for `condition
code' or `return code' interfacing to your OS.  The \maybe feature was
added to Web (\let\maybe=\no to get a listing of only changed modules).

16-Jan-83  Version 0.94 of TeX.  A few bug fixes. Tangle/Weave have @= and @/.
All the .WEB files changed to take advantage of new TeX and WEB features.

4-Dec-82  Version 0.9 of TeX.  Renamed a few macros in PLAIN.  Tops-20
 change file knows how to repeat your last run of TeX.  Slight enhancement
 to Weave's treatment of underscore.

21-Nov-82  TeX 0.8  New \if\else\fi. Old points: 72.27pt=2.54cm
The programs Tangle, Weave and TFtoPL just changed to fit the new
definitions of \ldot* in PLAIN, so you need not recompile them.

28-Oct-82  TeX 0.6  The primitive \: is gone (see TeX82.DIF) so all the .WEB
and .TEX files needed small changes.  TeX itself was changed substantially.
Small bug fix in PLtoTF 1.1.

23-Oct-82  TeX 0.5, plus other small bug fixes and additions.

5-Oct-82  Totally new hyphenation patterns.

27-Sep-82  Version 0 of Tex, Version 1 of everything else.
