This directory contains the TeX sources for "A Guide to TeX
for the Troff User."  It uses plain TeX augmented by some
ad-hoc macros in "paperhead.tex".  The file "intro.tex"
contains \input control words that read the other .tex commands.
So to produce the document, type

	tex intro

and stand back.  The final result will be intro.dvi and intro.log
(plus TOC.tex, a table-of-contents file).  Use your local TeX
output driver to get the thing on hard copy or your Sun screen
or whatever.

TRW sites should change the top three lines of title.tex so as
to produce the logo in the manner approved by the Corporate Identity
office.  If you are a TRW site and don't have the "trwlogo" font,
you should obtain it from the Software Productivity Project.
