.SH SYNOPSIS
.B patgen
dictionary_file pattern_file log_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Patgen
reads the
.I dictionary_file
and produces the
.IR pattern_file ,
writing a transcript of its actions on the
.IR log_file .
The
.I dictionary_file
should contain a list of hyphenated words and
previously-generated patterns.
.PP
The patterns thus generated can be read by
.I initex
for use in hyphenating words. For a (very) long example of
.IR patgen 's
output, see /usr/local/lib/tex/inputs/hyphen.tex, which contains the
patterns TeX uses for English.

All filenames must be complete. No adding of default
extensions is done.
