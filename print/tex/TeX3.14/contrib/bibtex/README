BibTeX is the LaTeX bibliography processor.  It was written by Oren
Patashnik of Stanford.  

Under normal conditions you will probably compile this as part of
web2c.  If for some reason you chose not to, you will have to
copy bibtex.web from TeX3.0/bibtex to here and see the final
paragraph in this readme.

For more information on BibTeX and its functions, see btxdoc.tex and also
bibtex.1

Copy *.sty and *.bst to your TeX macros directory
(/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs in the standard distribution).

To produce documentation, you will need to go through the following sequence:

	% latex btxdoc
	% bibtex btxdoc
	% latex btxdoc
	% latex btxdoc

The first "latex" produces the .aux file that BibTeX needs.  The "bibtex"
reads the .bib file and produces a .bbl file.  The second "latex"
incorporates that information into the .aux file. The third "latex" updates
the document.

To compile BibTeX using pascal, first uncompress the pascal_bibtex.shar file
and extract the parts, then make sure that texpaths.h, h00vars.h, and whoami.h
are set up correctly in the tex82 directory (using the appropriate pascal setup
shell script in that directory if they are not).  Do a Make to build BibTeX.
