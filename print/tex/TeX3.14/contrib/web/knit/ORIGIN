Dear Pierre, 
 
please excuse my later reply concerning the KNIT and TWIST programms
but I have been in Canada for two weeks. Except from this letter I shall
send you eight messages, each one containing a separate file. The first
line in the file tells you the name of the file. You should first have
a look at the file called README which should tell you all about the
seven other files. If you have problems please let me know
