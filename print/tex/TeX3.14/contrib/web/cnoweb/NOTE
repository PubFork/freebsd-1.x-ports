c-no-web is "an alternative to the CWEB 'literate
programming' system."  It enables you to tex the 
source you compile.  (Be sure to see Jim Fox's
article in TUGboat, vol. 11, no. 4 (Nov. 1990), 
pp. 511-13, for further details.)

The macro file "cnoweb.tex" should be copied to
your TEXINPUTS directory.  The source file "pf.c" 
demonstrates cnoweb literate programming.  

The command "tex pf.c" will produce a dvi file;
"cc pf.c" will compile the source.
