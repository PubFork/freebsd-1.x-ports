This mail contains the MAKEPROG system. The system consists of
three files: makeprog.web, progdoc.doc, and progdocu.tex.

-- progdocu.tex is a kind of user documentation, it is written with
   Plain TeX and should be printed first.

-- progdoc.doc is a macro package to document programs (e.g. macros).
   This macro file is documented with the MAKEPROG system itself.

-- makeprog.web is a WEB program that extracts the program part of a
   document written with progdoc.

I have added the file progdoc.tex, too. This file is the result of
a MAKEPROG run over progdoc.doc. It serves for two purposes: on the
one hand it is a test file for the makeprog program and on the other
hand it is needed to print progdoc.doc if you don't have a running
makeprog program.

I hope that this system is useful to everyone who wants to write
documented maintainable programs and not only tricky hacks.

                With regards

                        Joachim
