 \  This macro draws a horizontal double bond of a

 \begin{description}
 \item[{\rm \ \ \ \ \ \ Argument 1:}] An integer, expressing
      the length of the bond in printer points.
 \item[{\rm \ \ \ \ \ \ Argument 2:}] An integer, expressing
      the amount of vertical space by which the bonds have
      to be pushed together to give the desired vertical
      distance. In a document with double spacing, the
      number 19 produced the spacing in the double bond
      shown above.

 \ This macro is similar to \verb+\+dbond, except that it
 draws a triple bond:

 \[ \tbond{20}{20}  \]

 \verb+\+dbond. The number 20 was used as argument 2.

 \centerline{3. COMMON REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF THE SYSTEM}
 \vspace{\len mm}
 So far in this thesis it has been explained how to write
 LaTeX code to produce a chemical structure diagram at a
 particular place in a document. This section will discuss the
 mandatory and the optional statements at the beginning of an
 input file that make the system of macros accessible and
 its use more practical and convenient. Figure 6.1 contains
 these statements together with the two required declarations
 at the beginning of a LaTeX file, lines (1) and (9).
 (The line numbers are for reference only, they are not used
 in the input file.)

 The part of the input file preceding the \verb+\+begin\{document\}
 statement is called the ``preamble'' in the LaTeX Manual.
 In addition to the statements shown here, the preamble usually
 contains declarations pertaining to text formatting details
 such as margin width, text height on a page, and space between
 lines. 

 The statement in line (2) of figure 6.1 is necessary if the
 structure-drawing macros of this thesis are to be used for
 the preparation of a document. This statement reads the file
 init.tex into TeX's memory, a file that contains two short
 macros, \verb+\+initial and \verb+\+reinit. Macro \verb+\+initial
 defines the command sequences \verb+\+xi, \verb+\+yi, \verb+\+pw,
 \verb+\+pht, \verb+\+xbox, and \verb+\+len  as integer variables
 and assigns a count register to each of them.  The use of the
 first four variables in the picture declaration and the use
 of \verb+\+xbox in a minipage or parbox environment was
 explained in chapter III. The counter \verb+\+len is a general
 purpose integer variable for the user. All the variables
 except \verb+\+len are also given initial values. ---
 Furthermore, the unitlength for the picture environments is
 set to 0.1 printer points in \verb+\+initial. This is the
 recommended unitlength for the chemical structure diagrams,
 but it can be changed anywhere in the document. ---
 Line (11) from figure 6.1 expands \verb+\+initial. 

 The macro \verb+\+reinit simply resets all the parameters
 to their initial values from \verb+\+initial. It is a
 convenience, especially for cases where more than one
 variable needs to be reset.

   (11) \initial
  \end{verbatim}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{Statements at the beginning of a LaTeX file}
 \end{figure}
 
 The statement in line (3) of figure 6.1  reads a file                      
 with structure-drawing macros. There will usually be
 several such statements, reading in different macros or
 sets of macros. At the installation where this work was
 done the TeX memory is not large enough to read in all
 the chemistry macros. TeX's own macros already take up
 13\% of the reserved memory and when the LaTeX macros are
 added, two thirds of the memory are used before an
 input file is processed. --- Reading in just part of the 
 structure-drawing macros for any given document has the
 advantage of saving processing time.
 
 Lines (4) -- (8) in figure 6.1 affect the placement of
 ``floats'' on the page. The only floats discussed in this
 thesis are the diagrams produced in the figure
 environment (see chapter III). In defining the style
 of a document -- the report style is designated by line (1) -- 
 the LaTeX program sets default values for the maximum
 total number of floats on a page (three), the maximum
 number of floats at the top of the page (two), and at
 the bottom of the page (one). These values can be 
 changed for documents with an unusually large number
 of figures. Thus, lines (4) -- (6) increase the 
 maximum number of floats to 4, evenly distributed on
 the page. It is then necessary to change the counters
 \verb+\+topfraction and \verb+\+bottomfraction to
 reflect the distribution of figures on the page.

 Finally, line(10) is the optional redefinition of the
 math textfont, discussed in chapter III. This definition
 can be changed anywhere in the document.
