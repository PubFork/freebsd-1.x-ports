This directory contains RST font hacking programs and other miscellaneous
stuff.

Here is a brief overview of the directories

	bin		binaries [not included in the TeX distribution
				because of disk space--rkf]
	cmap		character layout tables
	doc		random documentation
	man		manual pages
	src		font hacking programs
	tex		dviimp driver [not included in the TeX distribution
				because of licensing restrictions and because
				of space.  This area contains programs which
				you should have already from imagen.
				Specifically, files are cvt-to-rst, dviimp.c,
				geom.h, imPcodes.h, newdvi.h, and site.h--rkf]
	troff		RST driver, changes for device independent troff
				[not included in the TeX distribution
				because of licensing restrictions.  Contact
				Lou Salkind directly if you want this--rkf]

I would appreciate hearing of any bugs or problems you may have.
Suggestions, comments, etc. also welcome.

Warning: this stuff represents work in progress, so documentation is
scarce and the programs surely have bugs (although I haven't seen any
yet).  Be kind to the author.
