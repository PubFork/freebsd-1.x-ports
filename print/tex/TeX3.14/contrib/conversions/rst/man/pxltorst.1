.TH PXLTORST 1 NYU
.SH NAME
pxltorst \- convert a PXL raster file to RST format
.SH SYNOPSIS
pxltorst [-r \fIres\fR] pxlfont rstfont
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pxltorst
takes as input a PXL raster file (as generated by METAFONT), and it
produces as output an RST raster file.  RST raster files
can be used by troff, TeX, and device independent troff post-processors.
.PP
By default,
.I pxltorst 
assumes the target device has a resolution of 240 dots per inch.
The -r option allows you to specify an alternative value.
PXL files are assumed to be used on a device with a resolution
of 200 dots per inch.
.PP
For example, to get a 10 point RST font on a 240 dot per inch printer,
one would convert a 10 point design PXL raster with 1.2 magnification
(by convention, a PXL file with this property would have the suffix
.1200pxl).  This would give an RST file with magnification 1.0 and design
size 10.
.PP
Alternatively, one could convert a 12 point PXL raster at
1.0 magnification; then the design size and character widths would have
to be modified.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Self explanatory
.SH BUGS
Does not convert the design size and character widths automatically if
desired (yet).
