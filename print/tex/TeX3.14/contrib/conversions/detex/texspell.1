.SH DESCRIPTION
TeX and LaTeX have control characters that
.B spell
does not recognize.
.I texspell
and
.I texproofr
first filter these control characters using
.I detex
and then pipe the result to
.B spell
or
.B proofr
respectively.
.br
TeX's and LaTeX's \\input and \\include files are recognized and opened.
If the
.B -i
flag is used, those files are ignored.
.br
Unmatching also is checked unless suppressed by the
.B -w
flag.
