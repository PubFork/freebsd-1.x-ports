Documentation for the TeX language may be found in "The TeXbook," by 
Donald Knuth, published by Addison Wesley (ISBN 0-201-13448-9).  The 
older manual, "TeX and Metafont, New Directions in Typesetting," 
published by Digital Press and the AMS, is obsolete.  You may also wish 
to consider getting "LaTeX," by Leslie Lamport, published by Addison 
Wesley (ISBN 0-201-15790-X).  Both of these books were typeset with the 
system they describe.  

Serious users of the TeX and METAFONT system should invest in the 5-volume 
set "Computers and Typesetting," published by Addison Wesley; and all 
users should invest in a membership in the TeX Users Group (P.O. Box 
594, Providence, R.I. 02901) to keep up to date on new developments.  
For members with access to electronic mail, another service of the TeX 
Users Group is the TeXhax E-mail Digest.
