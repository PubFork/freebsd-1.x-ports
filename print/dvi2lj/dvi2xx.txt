     NAME
          dvilj2, dvilj2p, dvilj, dviljp, dvi3812 - convert dvi files to HP
          LaserJet or IBM 3812 format

     SYNOPSIS
          dvi2lj [-afontpath] [-b ]  [-ccopies]  [-D]  [-eoutput  file]  [-
          ffrompage]  [-g] [-hheader file] [-l] [-mmag] [-ppages] [-q] [-r]
          [-ttopage] [-spagesize] [-v] [-w]  [-xxoff(mm)]  [-yyoff(mm)]  [-
          Xxoff(dots)] [-Yyoff(dots)] [-z] [filename]

     DESCRIPTION
          Dvilj2 converts TeX-output  .dvi  files  into  HP  PCL  (i.e.  HP
          Printer  Control Language) commands suitable for printing on a HP
          LaserJet+, HP LaserJet II and fully compatible printers.
          Dvilj2p converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL commands suit-
          able  for  printing  on  a HP LaserJet IIp, HP LaserJet III or HP
          Laserjet 2000 and fully compatible printers. This version uses  a
          newer PCL command set and provides landscape printing.
          Dviljp and dvilj are similar to dvilj2p and dvilj2 but they  sup-
          port  only  128  character  fonts.  They may be used for Laserjet
          clones which do not support 256 character fonts.
          Dvi3812 converts TeX-output .dvi files into PMP files, the native
          command language of the IBM 3812 page printer.
          All programs are generated from the same source  dvi2xx.c.   They
          are usually called by a shell script or as a line printer filter.


     OPTIONS

          -afontpath
               directory to take fonts  from  (alternative  to  environment
               variable  TEXPXL);  see  below  for  details  about the font
               directory structure

          -b
               take paper for first  page  from  alternate  cassette  (only
               3812)

          -cnumber
               print each page number times (including original)

          -D
               Double-sided printing - see  below;  -D1  prints  odd  sides
               only,  -D2 is for even pages, a trailing - suppresses print-
               ing of empty padding pages.

          -eoutput file
               default output filename is the  basename  of  dvi  file  and
               extension  '.lj'  for laserjet and '.pmp' for 3812. The '-e'
               option can be used to override this default  and  to  direct
               the  output  to  a different file. If the output filename is
               set to '-` (option '-e-') the output is directed  to  stdout
               and can be directly piped into a spooler.


                                                                          1

          If no arguments are specified a short help file is displayed.

     font directory structure
          The specified fontpath may contain  more  than  directory  names.
          Under Unix the direcory names are separated by a ':', under MSDOS
          by a ';'.  The paths are searched from left to  right.  For  each
          directory in the searchpath the following font naming conventions
          are tried:
          - dpi<resolution>/<fontname>.pk (eg: ./dpi300/cmr10.pk)
          - dpi<resolution>/<fontname>.pxl (eg: ./dpi300/cmr10.pxl)
          - pxl<magnification>/<fontname>.pk (eg: ./pxl1500/cmr10.pk)
          - pxl<magnification>/<fontname>.pxl (eg:./pxl1500/cmr10.pxl)
          - <fontname>.<resolution>pk (eg: ./cmr10.300pk)
          - <fontname>.<resolution>pxl (eg: ./cmr10.300pxl)
          - <fontname>.<resolution> (eg: ./cmr10.300)

     \special commands
          Two TeX '\special' commands are implemented:

          \special{file=<filename>}
               copy specified  file  to  the  printer;  either  vector-  or
               bitmap-graphics PMP commands (for laserjet and 3812)

          \special{orientation=<value>}
               set page orientation to 0, 1, 2, 3; rotate following  output
               to landscape mode etc.  (3812 only).

          others:


                                                                          3






     DVILJ2(1)


          There are a few other special  commands  implented  for  the  LJ-
          series,  which should only be used in connection with the distri-
          buted style files (eg graybox.sty). They are likely to be changed
          in forthcoming versions.

     Double Page Printing
          The command line option -D causes the printer to print  in  doub-
          lepage mode, that is - roughly speaking - printing first the even
          pagen and then the odd pages of a document.  If  -D  is  used  to
          print  both even and odd pages (-D is used without the optional 1
          or 2) the following will  happen  after  half  of  the  pages  is
          printed:

          3812: the printer beeps, shows message U1.  An  operator  has  to
                refill  the  printed  pages into the paper tray and to push
                the continue button on the printer.

          LJ:   the printer stops, shows message  "FEED"  and  switches  on
                manual  feed  led.  The  printer  continues when either the
                printed pages are fed into the manual page feeder,  or  the
                operator  pushes  the  continue button (after placing first
                the printed pages into the paper tray).

          If -D1 was specified only odd pages will be printed, -D2  can  be
          used  for  even  pages.  A trailing `-' (as in -D-, -D1- or -D2-)
          supresses printing of empty pages which are generated for padding
          otherwise.

          The  driver  allows  the  -D  option  for  both  print-directions
          (front-to-back  or back-to-front printing). It tries to be clever
          in certain cases: when a document has an odd number of  pages  it
          inserts  in  the right place an empty page when a document starts
          with page 0 the driver inserts an empty  page  after  the  0-page
          when  a  piece  of a document is printed that starts with an even
          page-number it prints this page at the backside of the first page
          to  ensure that the odd sides are always on the frontside. The 0-
          page is treated like an odd page.

          The doubleside option works for all LJs, not only for the  new  D
          model  with  does  doubleside-printing  (actually,  i  don't know
          wether it makes much sense on the new LJ II D at all).

          Caveat on the doubleside-option: When it is used frequently or on
          very  large files, it might become necessary to clean the printer
          much more frequently.

          The command line option -pX can be used to abort  printing  after
          the  output of X pages (can lead to strange results together with
          -D). I personally dislike this option. The secure way of printing
          a part of a document is using -f (from) and -t (to).

     ENVIRONMENT
          The environment variable TEXPXL can be used  to  specify  one  or
          more  paths  to  the raster fonts (.pk, .pxl). The path separator
          under Unix is ':', under MSDOS ';'. GF-fonts can be used when the
          source is compiled without the preprocessor switch USEPIXEL set.
