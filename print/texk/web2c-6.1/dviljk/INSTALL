Installation of dviljk (relative to the top-level directory):

1. Run `configure' (in the top-level directory).  This tries to figure out
system dependencies.

2. If necessary, edit the default paths or other definitions in
`./Makefile', `kpathsea/paths.h.in' and `*/c-auto.h'. See
kpathsea/INSTALL for more details on changing the default paths.

Things to add to DEFS or CFLAGS:
-DLJ, -DLJ2P to compile a binary for a plain LaserJet or a LaserJet IIP.
  The default DEFS is -DLJ4, for a LaserJet 4.
-DMAKETEXPK_BY_DEFAULT to enable MakeTeXPK by default.  It can be enabled (or
  disabled) at runtime, regardless (see the man page). MakeTeXPK must
  echo the generated filename (and nothing else) to standard output.
-DMFMODE=\"mode\" to change the default mode from ljfour (if LJFOUR) or
  cx (otherwise).
-DTIMING to enable timing flags. Must have various library functions.

3. `make'.

4. `make install'.

5. `make distclean' (or `mostlyclean', or `clean', or `realclean',
depending on how clean you want to be).
