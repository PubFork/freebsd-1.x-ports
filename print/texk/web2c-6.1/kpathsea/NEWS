This file records noteworthy changes.

1.8 (2 April 1994)
* New target install-info, so the documentation can be installed without
  the headers.
* Existing but unreadable files are complained about, instead of just ignored.
* A leading %% in a path element forbids searching the disk for that
  element; only a db will be searched (if it exists).
* The db is only used if it might be relevant to a given path element,
  not searched first regardless.

1.7 (1 March 1994)
* Searches can use an externally-built ls-R ``database'', for speed.
* `VPATH = .' lines removed from generated Makefile, for broken Sun make.
* A path foo//tfm finds foo/tfm as well as foo/*/tfm.

1.6 (3 February 1994)
* Memory fault in copying long paths fixed.
* More variables passed down from the top-level Makefile.
* Mention SMART_PUTENV in the INSTALL file, and fix bug in xputenv.c
  when one envvar is a proper prefix of another.
* More attempts at eliminating magstephalf annoyances.
* Directory name substitutions are done globally when creating paths.h.
* Various changes for DOS.

1.5 (24 January 1994)
* Default paths changed.
* Defining GCC_WCHAR lets GCC define wchar_t.
* EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS defined in all cases (if they're not already).
* str[r]chr never redefined (I hope).

1.4 (3 November 1993)
* Check closest fallback font size.
* All default paths (including dvips') in paths.h.in, not the Makefile.
* Rearrange directory lists so that dirs in which a file is found
  migrate to the top.
* Update for Autoconf 1.7.

1.3 (6 October 1993)
* Fix free of non-malloced memory bug.
* Fix uninitialized gf path bug.
* mkdirchain invoked as an absolute filename.

1.2 (27 September 1993)
* Running MakeTeXPK is tried before the fallback resolutions.
* The final bitmap name uses a variable spec, so DOS & OS/2 can get
  dpi300/cmr10.pk.
* Document TeX-specific features.
* Dpi passed to MakeTeXPK via the envvar KPATHSEA_DPI instead of MAKETEX_DPI.

1.1 (26 August 1993)
* Installation fixes.

1.0 (5 August 1993)
* Routines to look up TeX font files, default path specifications, etc.
* Sort-of pattern matching: /foo//bar matches subdirectories
  /foo/a/bar, /foo/b/bar, /foo/a1/a2/bar, etc.
* $var and ${var} expansion.
* Support for MakeTeX... scripts.
* Support for fallback resolutions and font.
* Lazy evaluation of path elements.
* Some runtime debugging support.
