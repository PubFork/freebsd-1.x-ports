This directory contains the Kpathsea[rch] library.
See `Makefile.in' for the version number.
See `NEWS' for changes by release.
See `INSTALL' for installation instructions.
See `PROJECTS' for future improvements.

The library provides for filename lookup through paths specified in
environment variables.  The main header file is pathsrch.h.  To support
that, there are lots of configuration headers and functions.

Report bugs to tex-k@cs.umb.edu.  (Email tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu to
join this mailing list.)

Suggestions for improvements (in either the library or the
documentation), no matter how small, are welcome.

Installing this package will create the library and header files in
subdirectories of /usr/local.

This is free software.  See the files COPYING* for copying permissions.
