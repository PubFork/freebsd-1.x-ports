This file records noteworthy changes.

1.8 (2 April 1994)
* Memory fault on `R' avoided when some fonts were not found.
* Always try closing files, instead of relying on errno==E[MN]FILE.
* EPSF files scaled with \magnification (thanks to Uwe Bonnes).
* Support for epsf decompression a la dvips (thanks to Karen Barrett).

1.7 (1 March 1994)
* Use DEFAULT_FIG_PATH, instead of DEFAULT_TEX_PATH (they are the same
  by default, anyway). 
* EPS displays take the magnification into account.

* The Metafont mode for MakeTeXPK can be set via the command line, an X
  resource, an environment variable, or at compile-time.

* SelFile support (thanks to Jon Peatfield).

* No xdvi changes, just keeping up with the Kpathsea fixes.

1.5 (24 January 1994)
* Try again to make the signal handling more reliable on the Alpha.
* Debugging option for EPS previewing.
