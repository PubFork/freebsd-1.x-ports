This directory contains Dvipsk, my (karl@cs.umb.edu) modified version of
Tom Rokicki's dvips.  See `ChangeLog' or `Makefile.in' for the version
number.  See `NEWS' for changes by release.

The file `INSTALL' explains the installation process, which I changed to
use a GNU-style (Autoconf-generated) `configure' script to guess
system-dependent information, instead of requiring the installer to do
everything in the Makefile.

Aside from configuration, this differs from the original primarily in
that it uses the same code for path searching as TeX, the GNU font
utilities, and xdvik, my similarly-modified xdvi.

Please report bugs to tex-k@cs.umb.edu, rather than Tom, so he is not
bothered with bugs that aren't in his program.  (Email
tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu with a line containing with a line containing

dvipsk is free software; Tom's original files are public domain.  The
files I wrote (originally for the Free Software Foundation) are covered
by the GNU General Public License.  See the files COPYING* for copying
permissions.

You can get the original dvips from labrea.stanford.edu:pub/dvips*.

Other general changes I made:

I changed config.ps; the original is in config.psr.  And I changed
MakeTeXPK and psfonts.map in (I intended) upward-compatible ways.

The documentation is now in Texinfo format.  I've removed the font
naming section, since it was an old version of the font naming document
(which you can get from ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/fontname/fontname.texi).
