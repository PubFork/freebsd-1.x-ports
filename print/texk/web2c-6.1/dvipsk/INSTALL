Installation
************

  *Note Reporting bugs: (kpathsea)Bugs, for the bug reporting address
and information.

  To compile and install Dvipsk:

   * Edit the top-level `Makefile.in' if you want to make changes that
     will have effect across different runs of `configure'; for example,
     changing the installation directories. Alternatively, override the
     Make variables on the command line when you run Make.

   * Edit `kpathsea/paths.h.in' to define your local default paths.
     *Note System dependencies: (kpathsea)System dependencies, for more
     details on changing the paths.

   * Run `sh configure' in the top-level directory.  This tries to
     figure out system dependencies and the installation prefix.  *Note
     The `configure' script: (kpathsea)configure, for options and other
     information about `configure'.

   * If necessary, edit the definitions in the files `Makefile' and in
     `dvipsk/c-auto.h' (which `configure' created.)

   * Run `make'; e.g., just type `make' in the top-level directory.
     Barring configuration and compiler bugs, this will compile all the
     programs.  See the `./MACHINES' for possibly helpful
     system-dependent information.

   * Check the paths in `MakeTeXPK', unless you do not want automatic
     font generation (in which case you need not install `MakeTeXPK' at
     all).  *Note Font Generation::.  The `MakeTeXPK' in the
     distribution will overwrite the installed file only if the latter
     contains the string `original MakeTeXPK --'. Dvipsk, unlike the
     original dvips, requires `MakeTeXPK' to echo the generated filename
     (and nothing else) to standard output (standard error can be used
     for commentary). For more details, or in general if your
     `MakeTeXPK' fails, *note Unable to Generate Fonts::..

   * Update the device parameters (available memory, resolution, etc.)
     in `config.ps'.  This file is installed as the system-wide
     configuration file.  *Note Config File Options::.  The `config.ps'
     in the distribution will overwrite the installed file only if the
     latter contains the string `original config.ps --'.

   * Install the programs and supporting macros, fonts, and data files
     with `make install'. If you want to install only the executables,
     do `make install-exec'; for only the data files, `make
     install-data'. And if you don't want to install the fonts (perhaps
     because your directory structure is different from the default),
     set the Make variable `install_fonts=false'.

   * If you want to use more than one device, create configuration
     files for each and install them in the directory named by the Make
     variable `configdir'.

   * A few Type 1 fonts (Utopia, Charter, Courier, ...) have been
     contributed by vendors to the X distribution, and are freely
     available. You can get TeX distributions for them from
     `ftp.cs.umb.edu' in `pub/tex', and from the CTAN hosts in
     `tex-archive/fonts'.

   * Your Unix system may have come with additional PostScript fonts.
     If so, you can make them available to Dvips by copying the files
     or making symbolic links with the appropriate filenames, and
     running `afm2tfm' (*note afm2tfm::.) to make TFM and VF files so
     the fonts will be available in the same encoding as the fonts
     distributed with Dvips. Also check `psfonts.map' to be sure the
     fonts are listed there (*note Non-resident Fonts::.).

     Here are the typical locations for vendor-supplied fonts:

    DEC Ultrix
          `/usr/lib/DPS/outline/decwin'

    DEC OSF/1
          `/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1Adobe'

    NeXT
          `/NextLibrary/Fonts/outline'

    SGI IRIX
          `/usr/lib/DPS/outline/base'

    Sun Solaris 2.3
          `/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/outline'
