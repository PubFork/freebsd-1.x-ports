The files latex.texi and latex2.texi contain TeXinfo sources which
document Leslie Lamport's LaTeX macro package for TeX.  The files were
produced from George Greenwade's LATEX.HLP file.

You can use the function `texinfo-format-buffer' from within Emacs to
generate an Info file or run TeX on the file to generate a DVI file.
The index can be generated using the FSF's texindex program.
