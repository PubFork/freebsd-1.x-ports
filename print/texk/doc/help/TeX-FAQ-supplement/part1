			Supplementary TeX Information           [STI.1994.01]

This is the so-called STI (Supplementary TeX Information) file, a supplement 
to the ``Frequently Asked Questions'' maintained by Bobby Bodenheimer
for newsgroup "comp.text.tex". Note that there is some duplication of material.
I am grateful to our readers for providing any up-to-date info. This document 
cannot be useful without your input and support. Please send email to me
(chenguo@slinky.cs.nyu.edu) if you have any suggestions and ideas to

--- start of apology
[I am so sorry that I have not been so active in reading comp.text.tex
and TeX related mailing list in the last several months due to the heavy 
load of my first full-time job in wall street... thanks 
"Jonathan I. Kamens" <jik@security.ov.com> for asking me to activate it.
Let it be one of my new year resolutons :-) ]
--- end of apology

*******************************   PART I   *******************************
[1] Major FTP sites for TeX and its friends

[1a] Major FTP sites
  Please bear in mind the geographical location of the site to which you
  intend to ftp.  (This can typically be determined by inspecting the
  last component in the site name.)  Overseas links tend to be slow and
  expensive.  Choose the closest available site.  Most sites discourage
  ftp'ing during normal business hours (local time).

[1c] How to find more sites
    The `archie' server contains file listings for hundreds of ftp sites.
    Telnet to quiche.cs.mcgill.ca [132.206.2.3] and type `archie' when asked
    to log in.  Then type `help'. (Currently, it still works!)
    OR, if your system has "archie", a program for querying archie
    anonymous ftp databases using Prospero.

===========================================================================
[2] Mail servers for selected sites.
    When using mail servers, bear several points in mind.
    (a) Follow the instructions carefully.  Each mail server
        accepts a different dialect of commands.  Make sure
        you aren't following server X's instructions when sending
        requests to server Y.
        Mail servers are computer programs and ill-formed requests
        tend to give mail server administrators migraine headaches.
        (I know, I'm one such administrator.)
    (b) Use mail servers only if you cannot obtain the files by
        ftp or other means.
    (c) Requesting large amounts of material via mail servers
        is frowned upon by system administrators.  Overuse of
        mail servers may result in the shutdown of said server.

niord.shsu.edu:
        via automatic FILESERV: include your email mesg to
	FILESERV@shsu.edu with
		sendme <subject>
	Questions go to: George D. Greenwade (bed_gdg@SHSU.BITNET)

ftp.cs.ruu.nl:  mail-server@cs.ruu.nl or uunet!mcsun!hp4nl!ruuinf
    Send the message
        begin
        path john@highbrow.edu (PLEASE SUBSTITUTE *YOUR* ADDRESS)
        send HELP
        end

ftp.uni-stuttgart.de:  mail-server@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
    [last confirmed: 30 Sep 91]
    Same instructions as for ftp.cs.ruu.nl.

ymir.claremont.edu: mailserv@ymir.claremont.edu
    To retrieve files from ymir via the mailserver, send a message to
    mailserv@ymir.claremont.edu with a line saying

        send [DIRECTORY]FILENAME

    where DIRECTORY is the FTP directory (sans "anonymous") and
    FILENAME is the filename, e.g. "send [tex]00readme.txt". There is
    a list of files in each directory under the name 00files.txt
    Binary files are not available by this technique.

sun.soe.clarkson.edu: archive-server@sun.soe.clarkson.edu
    Send the single word "help".  You will receive instructions on
    how to use the email server.

uk.ac.tex:
    Login as username "public" and password "public". Then get the
    file  [tex-archive]00readme.txt.   Access via mail server:
       Send a message to texserver@tex.ac.uk
       The message body must contain at least the following three lines
        starting in column 1.

atari.archive.umich.edu: atari@atari.archive.umich.edu
    Send the message "help" to receive instructions.

hearn.bitnet (Nijmegen, The Netherlands):
    Send the message GET TEX-L FILELIST to LISTSERV@HEARN.BITNET

DHDURZ1.BITNET:  primary source for the VM/CMS implementation and several
    drivers for IBM printers. Send a message containing the following three
    lines to <LISTSERV@DHDURZ1.BITNET>

    HELP
    GET README FIRST TEX
    GET TEX FILELIST

===========================================================================
[3] Systems for TeX and friends

[3a] TeX for Unix boxes
  get unix version from CTAN's /tex-archive/systems/unix.
    e.g.  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (129.69.8.13)

  See also [10] of PART II for other ftp sites for UNIX TeX package.
  Notice that the site at university of washington has suspended the
  service due to the budget cut. (contact mackay@cs.washington.edu)

[3b] TeX for IBM PC
-------------------
 The definitive source for public domain PC TeX-related software is Jon
 Radel.  His catalog which is currently 40 pages long contains several
 versions of TeX for the PC, device drivers, fonts, macros, TUG
 documents, etc.  The physical distribution of the disks has been taken
 over by TUG.  The catalog should be free for the asking.  The final
 determination on prices for disks has not yet been determined, but
 for the moment, software is distributed on 5.25" 360K and 1.2M floppy
 disks.  3.5" disks are available by prior arrangement.  There is a
 charge of $3.50/floppy in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico; $4.00/floppy
 elsewhere.

 Major sources of ftp sites are listed in part [1a] and [10].
 particularly see
    DOSTeX, emTeX, emTeX386, Public TeX, SBTeX and related entries in [10].

[3c] TeX for Macintosh
-----------------------
o Textures (lowercase 'x') [C]:
  A nice system, fast, and well-featured. The editor leaves a
  little to be desired, but with a good DA editors, that's not a big issue.

  If you buy it from the TeX Users Group, they will get the vendor royalty.
     TeX Users Group
     P.O. Box 9506
     Providence, RI 02940-9506
     Phone: 401-751-7760

  The publisher is Blue Sky Research,
  534 SW Third Avenue, Portland, OR 97204.

o OzTeX: You can't beat the price on this one. It's free (public
  domain even). It comes with source, and a web-to-modula2 program.
  The nice (or not) feature of this program is that it uses PK and TFM files
  directly (unlike Textures which bundles them into Mac formats).
  Another nice feature is that OzTeX creates dvi files directly.

  Available via anonymous ftp from:

  midway.uchicago.edu in pub/sources/OzTeX.
  watmsg.waterloo.edu (129.97.129.9) in pub/oztex.
  ymir.claremont.edu (goes without saying)

o DirectTeX: runs under MPW (Apple's development system with a
  command line interface, making it look a bit UNIX-alike.
	It can be found on ftp.uni-stuttgart.de in the directory:
	pub/mac/tex/directtex
  Note that DirectTeX is ShareWare.

x MacTeX: FTL is officially defunct, and MacTeX is no longer available.

o CTeX:  The web2c version ported to the Mac (under MPW).
         Available from ymir and midway.

[4] LaTeX styles and macros

From the issue of March, 1992, we began providing brief information about
main sites that archive LaTeX style files, and some additional info.
This part is not an attempt to list all sites exhaustively, but a
guide for searching your desired style files potentially available in
these resources.
Your contributions and comments to this part are especially welcome.

Notice that dmjones@theory.lcs.mit.edu (David M. Jones) has compiled
a "TeX Index" for TeX styles. Contact him for more info if you cannot
find the style you want from following sources.

[5] About Metafont, fonts
	Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posted a digest document about
available Metafont Fonts in comp.text.tex, on 3 May 92 03:48:55 GMT.
Part II section [10] lists some of avail fonts for Metafont in PUBLIC DOMAIN.
See also section [9] for relevant information along with Other-than-English TeX.

CMTTSS package:  includes the METAFONT source files for Arthur Ogawa's
<ogawa@orion.arc.nasa.gov> family of fixed pitch, sans serif, condensed
fonts.  These fonts are provided in three weights (light, regular, and
bold) and are based on cmbase and cmtt10. To retrieve the package,
ftp Niord.SHSU.edu (192.92.115.8) in the directory [FILESERV.CMTTSS].

===============================================================================
[6] TeX-related mailing lists

There are two basic classes of mailing lists.  The UNIX-style one
and the BITNET-style one.  For UNIX-style mailing lists, send your
add request to the address provided.  A human being will respond.
For BITNET-style mailing lists, send a message to the LISTSERV address
provided containing the line

    SUB name-of-mailing-list your-name

For example,
    SUB YUNUS Guoying Chen
and a computer program will respond.

You can tell the difference because the UNIX-style ones are just an
address, while the BITNET-style ones have a name plus an address.

cct-Digest:  	Good for those without net access. (thanks to
		bed_gdg@SHSU.edu (George D. Greenwade) )
        Ctt-Digest includes posts made to comp.text.tex, excluding
	(a) posts which got there from INFO-TeX and (b) the
	periodicals which are carried on TeX-Pubs (TeXhax Digest,

[9] Other-than-English TeX and friends
  From time to time, people ask about the avalaibility of TeX processing
  languages other than English. From this issue (June 1992), we summarize
  all info we have here:

  In standard Unix TeX distribution, it includes the babel package, a
  collection of various language fonts:
    Classical Greek, Modern Greek, Hebrew, Modern Icelandic, Cyrillic,
    Modern Turkish, German (Gothic/Fraktur).
  On host ymir.claremont.edu, you might be able to find more other langs
  under the directory LOCAL:[ANONYMOUS.TEX.BABEL].

  For other languages, you might want to look at these (might be the lastest):

  Arabic:  pylos.nmsu.edu see pub dir.
	   see ArabTeX 

  Chinese:
	   see 	pmC --- poorman's Chinse TeX 
		cc2tex --
		ChTeX --
	   the good sites to find interesting Chinese text processing stuff
	   are crl.nmsu.edu (128.123.1.14), pylos.nmsu.edu and ahkcus.org.
	   with much more recent stuff are sites of ifcss.org and cnd.org.

  Dutch:
	   see 	dutchsort.bib -- sorts non-English (esp. Dutch) names properly.

	The french-speaking TeX Users Group (GUTenberg) has is own archives on
	ftp.cicb.fr (129.20.128.2) at /pub/GUTenberg	
	The appropriate stuff for French-Speaking users is available also 
	separately in his distribution called "the french style files" 
	which includes hyphenation & abbreviation files, (La)TeX style, etc.
	with inline documentation and test files, at /pub/GUTenberg/french.
	All other french stuffs around the world are now obsoleted (specially:
