    The PicTeX manual is not available in electronic form (at least, not
    legally).  Manual can be obtained from TUG.  Contact Tug@Math.AMS.com
    for more information.
    If you have a copy of the file pictex.dvi at your site, delete it now.
    Printing of that file is a violation of international copyright law.
    Funds from the sale of the PiCTeX manual are the only renumeration Michael
    Wichura (author of the package) gets for his work, and by illegally copying
    the manual, you not only deprive him of income he deserves, but also
    decrease the possibility of his releasing future macro packages under terms
    similar to those of PiCTeX.
    Note also that numerous bugs have been found in the LaTeX parts.
    As of 4 Oct 90, the most recent version is available only from ymir.
    The bug fixes will be included on future disks shipped by TUG.

The original list is due to Ed Vielmetti (emv@ox.com).  The information
was originally sorted by site.  Until 31-Dec-91, the document was
maintained by Raymond Chen (rjc@math.princeton.edu). Thanks for their good
work. Since Jan. 1, 1992, this document has been owned to Guoying Chen
(chenguo@lab.ultra.nyu.edu), the document structure was re-organized in June, 1992.

Thanks to all the people whose articles in comp.text.tex I've ruthlessly
excerpted.  Opinions are those of the original authors (even though I've
lost many of the attributions), but if you want to blame me for them,
go ahead.

Thanks also to all the people who've sent me corrections, to the
authors of all the software, and to the many nameless administrators
which keep FTP sites up and running.
