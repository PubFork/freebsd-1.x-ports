Bibliography
************

Editors note: the following books have been suggested by readers of
comp.fonts.  They are listed in no particular order.  I have lost the
citations for some of the submissions.  If you wrote a review that
appears below and you aren't credited, please let norm know.

I have decided that this is the best section for pointers to other font
resources (specs and other documents, for example).  These appear after
the traditional bibliographic entries.  As usual I will happily accept
entries for this section.  As of 9/92, the only files listed are the
TrueType font information files available from Microsoft

Bill Ricker contributed the following general notes:

The Watson-Guptill, Godine, and Dover publishers all have many
typography titles. Godine and Dover tend to be excellent; W-G tends
toward 'how-to' books which are good for basics and juried Annuals of
job work.

Hermann Zapf and his Design Philosophy, Society of Typographic Arts,
Chicago, 1987.

On Stone -- The Art and Use of Tyography on the Personal Computer,
Sumner Stone, Bedford Arts, 1991.

Of the Just Shaping of Letters, Albrecht Durer, isbn 0-486-21306-4.

First published in 1525 as part of his theoretical treatise on applied
geomentry, "The Art of Measurment".

Champ Flevry, Geofroy Troy.

First published in 1529 Troy attempts, in this book, to design an ideal
Roman alphabet upon geometrical and aesthetic principles.

The Alphabet & Elements of Lettering, Frederic W. Goudy, isbn
0-486-20792-7. Revised 1942 edition.

This very intresting book looks at the history of letter shapes as well
font design.

The Mac is Not a Typewriter, Robin Williams, Peachpit Press.

A good, clear explanation of what typography is, and how to get it from
your computer. Mac-specific, but full of excellent general advice. I
think there's also a PC version. Available at most computer bookstores

Rhyme and Reason: A Typographic Novel, Erik Spiekermann, H. Berthold AG,
    ISBN 3-9800722-5-8.

Printing Types (2 vols), Daniel Berkely Updike, Dover Press.

Affordable edition of the most readable history of type, lots of
illustrations.

Notes: Both the Dover and Harvard U. P. editions where 2 volumes.  The
Dover editions were paperback and the Harvard hardback.  It appears
that the Dover edition is out of print.  Collectible HUP editions are
not cheap although later HUP editions may be had.  Most libraries have
later HUP and Dover editions.  If someone knows of a source, please
pass it along.

The Art of Hand Lettering, Helm Wotzkow, Dover Press, reprint from 1952.

Looking Good In Print, Roger C. Parker, Ventana Press,       ISBN:
0-940087-32-4.

Well, as a beginner's book, [it] isn't bad. I can't say that I agree
with the author's tastes all the time, but he at least gives some good
examples. Also there are some nice _Publish_-style makeovers.  Don
Hosek <dhosek@ymir.claremont.edu>

Book Design: A Practical Introduction, Douglas Martin, Van Nostrand
Reinhold, New York: 1989. 206pp.

Along with Jan White's book (see below), this provides a fairly
complete guide to book design.  Martin's book is somewhat more
conservative in outlook and also reflects his UK background.  Don Hosek
<dhosek@ymir.claremont.edu>

Digital Typography: An Introduction to Type and Composition for Computer
System Design, Richard Rubinstein, Addison-Wesley, Reading,
Massachusetts: 1988. 340pp.

An interesting, technological approach to typography which is worth
reading although not necessarily always worth believing. A not
insubstantial portion of the text is dedicated to representing type on
a CRT display and Rubinstein devotes some time to expressing
characteristics of typography numerically.  Don Hosek
<dhosek@ymir.claremont.edu>

Graphic Design for the Electronic Age, Jan V. White, Watson-Guptill
Publications, New York: 1988. 212pp.

A good handbook for document design. In a well-organized approach,
White covers the principles for laying out most of the typographics
features of a technical document. White is a bit overeager to embrace
sans-serif types and in places his layout ideas seem a bit garish, but
it's still a quite worthwhile book.  Don Hosek
<dhosek@ymir.claremont.edu>

Xerox Publishing Standards: A Manual of Style and Design, Watson-Guptill
Publications, New York: 1988. 400pp.

Overall, a disappointing book. It is divided into four sections of
widely varying intent: "Publishing Process," "Document Organization,"
"Writing and Style" and "Visual Design." None of them is really
adequate for the task and all are highly centered on the Xerox method
for publishing. As a guide to Xerox' process, it succeeds, but as a
manual for general use, it falls far short. In print.  Don Hosek
<dhosek@ymir.claremont.edu>

Methods of Book Design (3rd edition), Hugh Williamson, Yale University
Press, New Haven: 1983. 408pp.

It is a bit out-of-date as regards technology, but on issues relating
purely to design it is comprehensive and definitive.  Well, I suppose
it could be argued that printing technology influences design - e.g.
some types look fine in metal but lousy in digital imagesetting - and
therefore a book that is out-of-date in technology can't really be
"definitive" in matters of design either. In any event, _Methods_ is
more than adequate for a beginner's needs.  My paper-bound copy (ISBN
0-300-03035-5) was \$13.95; cheap at twice the price!  Cameron Smith
<cameron@symcom.math.uiuc.edu>

The Thames & Hudson Manual of typography, Rauri McLean, Thames & Hudson

An excellent book if you start getting more interested in type.  Look
for Rauri McLean's other books after this one...  Liam R.E. Quin
<lee@sq.com>

Typography and Why it matters, Fernand Baudin.

There is no better introduction than [it].  It's not a primer on
subjects such as "what does Avant Garde look like," or "This is a good
font for books." It is a good primer on the things you need to know
before the rest should be considered. He's a lovely writer, to boot.

[My copy is at work, so I may have munged the title-look up Baudin in
"Books in Print" and improvise :-)]

Ari Davidow <ari@netcom.com>

Better Type, Betty Binns

It's definitely not a lightweight beginner's introduction, but I've
found [it] to be indispensable.  It's a large-format hardcover, but you
can find it remaindered for cheap if you look around.  The book goes
into great detail about how factors like line spacing, line length,
point size, and design of typeface (evenness of stroke weight,
x-height, etc.) affect readability.  When you've gotten the basics out
of the way and want to learn more about the fine nuances of type color,
this book is an absolute must.  David Mandl <dmandl@bilbo.shearson.com>

Printing Types: An Introduction..., S. Lawson, (revised) 1990

A typography for desktop publishers who want to absorb some style.
Informed by the historical european tradition and the desktop
advertising, tempered by oriental yin-yang and examples. A page-turner
with repeat-read depth.

The only book I've seen that discusses page proportions that admits
there are more than three ways that describes how to find one that
feels good for your page. [wdr]

In print again (or still?); the ISBN above may be stale.

A great introduction to the issues of practicality and taste that

understand 18th and 19th century typography in context, this writer
lived the transition  from eclectic to standard sizes, and comments
with taste. [wdr]

"Working catalog of a specialty Graphics Arts shop.  They use
proprietary optical special effects techniques to get Desktop
Publishing effects, and more, without the laser-printer grain.  Great
listing of 19th Century Decorated Types - probably the largest
collection in the world. Prices to order headlines from them are NOT
cheap however.  Their services are for professional or serious hobby
use only. Solo's previous Dover books show some number of complete
alphabets of a  general peculiar style; this one shows small fragments
of his entire usable collection, important as an index.  (According to
private correspondence, they have more faces that have not yet been
restored to usable condition.) Not well indexed, but indexed." [wdr]

Stop Stealing Sheep & find out how type works, Erik Spiekermann & E.M.

Sheep Book, but conveys a feeling of love and respect for the letter
forms, and covers a lot of ground very, very well." [Liam]

Printing Types: Their History, Forms & Use, Daniel Berkely Updike,
Harvard University Press, reprint by Dover.

The standard reference. Tour-de-force history of type and type-styles.
A trifle conservative in its biases, but typography is conservative for
good reason: readibility. Check the addenda for his final words on
newer faces. [wdr]

1.  I believe the Dover edition to be 3 vols Pbk; both the collectable
and later Harvard U.P. editions were two vols hbk.

2.  I am informed by my bookseller & Books In Print that the Dover

"Gives examples of most typefaces, almost all digital, designed &
distributed  in the last 30 years. Cross indexed by foundry and
designer, and sources and  looks-likes. Some historical bits.  Shows
full a-z,A-Z,0-9, a few points  (punctuation); and 0-9 again if both
lining and oldstyle supplied.  Only   complaint is that it omits small
caps even from what few fonts have 'em and the accented characters, of
which most have some but too few.  List \$25." [wdr]

Manuale Typographicum, Hermann Zapf,  MIT Press, 0-262-74004-4

There are two books of this title  (portrait and landscape); this is
the only mass-market edition of either. Both are Zapf's selections of

Microsoft Windows 3.1 Programmer's Reference, Microsoft Press.

Documents the Panose system of typeface classification.  Probably
contains a general discussion of TrueType under MS Windows 3.1.

Introduction to Typography, 3rd ed, Faber, London, 1962.

A very good introduction for any beginner. Also discusses things like
illustrations and cover design, although not in great detail.

Simon was a purist, as the editor of the 3rd edition remarks.  He did
not mention phototypesetting in his original edition, but some
observations on its uses and abuses have since been added.  Anders

TrueType
********

George Moore announces the following information regarding TrueType
fonts:

"I am pleased to announce that there is now one central location for all
official Microsoft TrueType information available on the Internet.  The
9 files listed below are available for anonymous ftp access on
ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9) in the /vendor/microsoft/TrueType-Info
directory.  The most important of those files is the TrueType Font Files
Specifications, a 400 page book which describes in excruciating detail
how to build a TrueType font.  Other information is also available in
the same directory and other files will be added from time to time.

For those people who do not have ftp access to the Internet can find the
same information available for downloading on Compuserve in the
Microsoft developer relations forum (GO MSDR) in the TrueType library.

Please be aware that the TrueType specifications is a copyrighted work
of Microsoft and Apple and can not be resold for profit.

TrueType developer information files on ftp.uu.net:

  1. ttspec1.zip, ttspec2.zip, and ttspec3.zip

     The TrueType Specification:

     These three compressed files contain the "TrueType Font Files
     Specifications", a 400 page book complete with illustrations which
      details how to construct a TrueType font from scratch (or build
     a tool   to do so), the TrueType programming language, and the
     complete format   of each sub-table contained in the .TTF file.
     These documents are   stored in Word for Windows 2.0 format and
     require Windows 3.1 for   printing.  See the "readme.doc" (in
     ttspec1.zip) for printing   instructions.  Requires 2.5MB of disk
     space after uncompression.

     This manual is a superset of the similar specifications from Apple
     and   has added information specific to Windows that is not
     present in the   Apple version.

  2. ttfdump.zip

     An MS-DOS executable which will dump the contents of a TrueType
     font   out in a human-readable fashion.  It allows you to dump the
     entire   font, or just specific sub-tables.  This tool, combined
     with the   specifications above, allows very effective debugging
     or exploration   of any TrueType font.  For example, to dump the
     contents of the 'cmap'   (character code to glyph index mapping)
     table, enter:

     ttfdump fontname.ttf -tcmap -nx

     Entering "ttfdump" with no options will give you a help message.

  3. ttfname.zip

     Example C source code on how to parse the contents of a TrueType
     font.    Although this particular example will open up the file
     and locate the   font name contained within the 'name' table, it
     could be readily   adapted to parse any other structure in the
     file.  This compressed zip   file also contains many useful
     include files which have pre-defined   structures set up for the
     internal tables of a TrueType font file.    This code may be
     useful for developers who wish to parse the TrueType   data stream
     returned by the GetFontData() API in Windows 3.1.

  4. tt-win.zip

     A 31 page Word for Windows 2.0 document which is targeted for the
     Windows developer who is interested in learning about some of the
      capabilities TrueType adds to Windows 3.1.  Contains many
     illustrations.

  5. embeddin.zip

     A text file which describes all of the information necessary for a
      Windows developer to add TrueType font embedding capabilities to
     their   application.  Font embedding allows the application to
     bundle the   TrueType fonts that were used in that document and
     transport it to   another platform where the document can be
     viewed or printed   correctly.

  6. tt-talk.zip

     The TrueType Technical Talks 1 and 2.  These text files describe
     some   of the things that are happening with TrueType behind the
     scenes in   Windows 3.1.  The first document walks the reader
     through all of the   steps that occur from when the user first
     presses the key on the   keyboard until that character appears on
     the screen (scaling, hinting,   drop out control, caching and
     blitting).  The second talk describes   one of the unique features
     of TrueType called non-linear scaling which   allows the font
     vendor to overcome some of the physical limitations of   low
     resolution output devices.

  7. lucida.zip

     This text file contains useful typographic information on the 22
     Lucida fonts which are contained in the Microsoft TrueType Font
     Pack   for Windows.  It gives pointers on line-layout, mixing and
     matching   fonts in the family and a little history on each
     typeface.  This   information was written by the font's designers,
     Chuck Bigelow & Kris   Holmes."

Unicode Information
*******************

[ed: This is a summary of the Unicode info I've gleaned from the net
recently, the whole Unicode issue needs to be addressed better by the
FAQ...someday...  someday...I'll get to reorganize the whole thing]

Unicode Editing
===============

James Matthew Farrow contributes:

I use `sam' for all by text editing.  It is X editor based on an editor
for the blit called jim.  Papers describing sam as well as a
distribution of sam itself are available for ftp from research.att.com.
The sam there is a Unix port of the Plan 9 version.  Plan 9 is a full
unicode operating system, even around before NT!  The libraries sam is
built upon therefore support 16 bit wide characters.  The graphics
library, supplied with it at present does not.  However they may be
planning to distribute a new version which does soon.  The library just
plugs in replacing the library that comes with sam.  No modification is
necessary.  Character are stored using the utf-2 encoding.

All of the files I had before I started working with sam were 7 bit
ascii so no conversion was needed.  Now I have ditched xterm in favour
of 9term: a terminal emulator in the style of 81/2 (the Plan 9
interface).  This lets me type Unicode characters on the command line,
as part of filenames, in mail, wherever and most Unix utilities cope
without modification.  This is about to be released.  I'm looking for
beta testers.  ;-)

Is a special keyboard required?
-------------------------------

No.  ASCII Characters are typed as normal.  Common characters above
0x7f are typed using two letter abbreviations.  The table is similar to
the troff special character codes, e.g, Alt-12 gives you a 1/2, Alt-'e
gives you e acute, Alt-bu a bullet and so on.  This table is hardwired
into the library at present but is trivial to change.  Other codes are
accessed by typing their hex value, for instance the smiley is
Alt-X263a (0x263a being a smiley character in the Unicode character
set).

Is roman-to-Unicode conversion available?
-----------------------------------------

All normal 7 bit ascii characters are encoded as themselves so no
translation is needed.  There are conversion routines in the library
(runetochar and chartorune) which will do the conversion and it should
be pretty simple to convert files already in another format.  You would
have to write something to do the transliteration yourself.  A small
patch to the system would let you enter different language `modes' for
text entry.

Are there PostScript or TrueType fonts available?
=================================================

Apparently there is a version of the Lucida fonts by Bigelow and Holmes
which support Unicode.  This is the information I have on them.

[ed: quoting another source]

[Windows NT] will ship with a Unicode TrueType font containing
approximately 1,500 characters.  The font is called "Lucida Sans
Unicode" and was specifically designed by Bigelow and Holmes for
Microsoft to contain the following Unicode sets:

     ASCII
     Latin 1
     European Latin
     Extended Latin
     Standard Phonetic
     Modifier Letters
     Generic Diacritical
     Greek
     Cyrillic
     Extended Cyrillic
     Hebrew
     Currency Symbols
     Letterlike Symbols
     Arrows
     Mathematical Operators
     Super & Subscript
     Form & Chart Components
     Blocks
     Geometric Shapes
     Miscellaneous Technical
     Miscellaneous Dingbats

The bitmap fonts which comes with the utf version of the libXg graphics
library (the library upon which sam is built) support a sparse subset
of the full character set.  That is, only a few of them have glyphs at
present.  A font editor such as xfedor would let you add more.  The list
of those currently available is pretty much as the above list.

I use 9term and sam as a matter of course now and have for several
months.  I enjoy the convenience of putting special characters and
accented characters in my mail as well as being able to do some
phonetic work all in the one terminal/editor suite.

Can I Print Checks with the MICR Font?
**************************************

This comes up all the time: standard ordinary laser toner is magnetic
and will be read by the banks.  The gotcha is that standard laser toner
rubs off in the *very* high-speed sorting equipment that are used, and
this makes read rates drop low and the banks will hate you.

I researched check printers for a customer, and was surprised to find
this.  The Troy(tm) printers he bought are basically stock Ricoh
engines that have slightly tighter paper handling (for registration),
plus they add a proprietary Teflon-type power coating on the output
path to coat the checks.

I saw some examples of checks printed with and without this special
coating after running through something like 40 passes through check
processing equipment, and the one without the coating was a mess. These
require special handling that the banks do *not* like.  Apparently,
they go after companies that issue these kinds of checks with special
processing fees.

Rules of Thumb
**************

It is difficult to set out guidelines for font usage, because almost
any rule can be brilliantly broken under the right circumstances.

   * General guidelines:

        * Never lose track of the kind of work you're doing. An effect
          that would ruin a newsletter might be just the thing for a
          record cover.  Know when you can safely sacrifice legibility
          for artistic effect.

        * Keep in mind the final reproduction process you'll be using.
          Some effects (like reversed type, white on black) can be hard
          to read off an ordinary 300-dpi laser, but will work if
          finals are done on a high-resolution printer, such as a
          Linotronic. Will the pages be photocopied? Offset? Onto rough
          paper, shiny paper?  All these factors can and should
          influence your choice of fonts and how you use them.

        * Running some comparative tests is a good idea. Better to blow
          off a few sheets of laser paper now than to see a problem
          after thousands of copies are made.

        * No one can teach you font aesthetics; it must be learned by
          example.  Look at beautiful magazines, posters, books with
          wide eyes, so that you can see how it's done. Examine ugly
          printed matter critically and consider why it's hard to read.

   * Good rules of thumb:

        * If you need a condensed font, find one that was designed that
          way, rather than scaling an existing font down to a
          percentage.  Any scaling distorts a font's design; excessive
          scaling interferes with legibility - this goes for widening
          as well as narrowing. Extended faces do exist, although they
          aren't as common as condensed ones.

        * Many people feel that bold or italic type, or type in ALL
          CAPS, is more legible: "This is the most important part of
          the newsletter, let's put it in bold." In fact, legibility
          studies show that such type is actually harder to read in
          bulk. Keep the text in a normal style and weight, and find
          another way to emphasize it - box it, illustrate it, run it
          in color, position it focally.

        * Too much reverse type - white on black - is hard on the eyes.
          It can be a nice effect if used sparingly. Don't reverse a
          serif font, though - its details will tend to fill in. Stick
          to reversing bold sans-serifs, and remember to space them out
          a bit more than usual.

        * It is always safest to use a plain serif font for large
          amounts of text. Because Times is widely used, it doesn't
          mean it should be avoided. Fonts like Palatino, Times,
          Century Old Style are deservedly popular because people can
          read a lot of text set in such faces without strain.

          Don't expect anyone to read extensive text set in a condensed
          font.

        * As point size gets bigger, track tighter, and (if the
          software allows) reduce the spacebands as well. A spaceband
          in a headline size (anything over 14 point) should be about
          as wide as a letter "i".

        * If you only have a few large headlines, hand-kerning the
          type, pair by pair, can make the end result much more
          pleasing.  Besides, working with fonts this closely makes
          them familiar.

        * Column width and justification are major elements in design.
          The narrower the column, the smaller the type can be; wide
          rows of small type are very hard to read. Often it's a better
          idea to set narrow columns flush left rather than justified,
          otherwise large gaps can fall where hyphenation isn't
          possible.

        * Use curly quotes.

        * Don't put two spaces at the end of a line (.  ) instead of (.
          ) when using a proportionally spaced font.

A Brief Introduction to Typography
**********************************

Space, time, and bandwidth are too limiting to provide a complete
introduction to typography in this space.  I'd be very willing to make
one available for anonymous ftp, if you want to write one, but I'm not
going to write it-I have neither the time nor the expertise.  However,
the following description of Times, Helvetica, and Courier will suffice
for a start.  For more information, several books on typography are
listed in the bibliography.

Comments by Laurence Penney:
============================

Laurence Penney offers the following description of Times, Helvetica,
and Courier:

Times is a typeface designed in the 1930s for the Times newspaper in
London and is now used widely in books, magazines and DTP. Its design
is based on the typographical principles evolved since Roman times
(upper case) and the 16th century (lower case). It is called a
TRANSITIONAL typeface, after the typefaces of the 17th century which it
resembles.  Like all typefaces designed for typesetting large
quantities of text, it is proportionally spaced: the i takes about a
third the width of an M.  Personally I don't like Times too much and
prefer the more elegant Garamond and Baskerville, but these will
probably cost you money...  Note: The Transitionals came after the Old
Styles (like Garamond) and before the Moderns (like Bodoni).

Helvetica is an example of a SANS-SERIF typeface. These first appeared
in the late 19th century in Germany and flourished in the 1920s and
30s, when they were regarded as the future of typography.  It's more a
geometric design than the humanist design of Gill Sans, but less
geometric than Avant Garde and Futura. To my mind it lacks elegance,
and Adrian Frutiger's Univers shows how this kind of typeface should be
done. (Just compare the B, R, Q, a, g of Univers and Helvetica to see
what I mean - and don't you just love Univers's superbly interpreted
ampersand ?!) Helvetica is one of the few fonts that is improved by its
BOLD version.

Another interesting approach to sans-serif is Optima, by Hermann Zapf,
which keeps the stroke-weight variations which sans-serifs usually
reject. Use sans-serif fonts for the same applications as Times, above,
but where you're less concerned with elegance, and more with a
functional appearance - they're generally reckoned to be slightly less
legible than good serifed fonts. They're also very suitable for display
work.

Courier is a typeface derived from typewriter styles. It should ONLY be
used when you want to simulate this effect (e.g. when writing letters
Courier usually appears "friendlier" than Times). Like all typewriter
fonts, it is MONOSPACED (characters all have the same width) and is
thus suitable for typesetting computer programs. However there are
nicer looking monospace fonts than Courier (which has oversize serifs),
that still remain distinct from the text fonts like Times and
Helvetica. A good one is OCR-B, designed by Frutiger. Note that
monospaced fonts are less economical on space than proportional fonts.

[ed: Following the original posting of this message, Laurence Penny and
Jason Kim discussed the issue privately.  The following summary of
their discussion may serve to clarify some of the more subtle points.
My thanks to Laurence and Jason for allowing me to include this in the
FAQ.]

                     -----------------------------

LP-1> The Transitionals came after the Old Styles (like Garamond) and
before the Moderns (like Bodoni).

JK> Not necessarily true!  Ideologically, yes, but not chronologically.
I believe, for example, that Bodoni predates New Century Schoolbook or
some such typeface.

LP-2> What I meant by "X came after Y" was "the first examples of X
appeared after the first examples of Y" - it's called precis. Some
people still make steam trains, but you can still say "Steam engines
came before diesels." This is chronological, not ideological in my book.

                     -----------------------------

LP-1> Another interesting approach to sans-serif is Optima, by Hermann
Zapf, which keeps the stroke-weight variations which sans-serifs
usually reject. Use sans-serif fonts for the same applications as
Times, above, but where you're less concerned with elegance, and more
with a functional appearance - they're generally reckoned to be
slightly less legible than good seriffed fonts. They're also very
suitable for display work.

JK> Slightly? I have several textbooks typeset by utter fools and they
are a pain in the ass (and eyes) to read! Please don't encourage anyone
to use Optima (or any sans serif fonts for that matter) "for the same
applications as Times," which, need I remind you, was designed for
*newspaper* work!!

LP-2> OK, maybe I was a little over-generous to Univers, Helvetica,
etc., but I think variation is extremely important in typography. Have
you ever read the British magazine "CAR" ? That uses Helvetica light (I
think) in a very legible and attractive way, IMO.  I agree, though,
Optima is crappy for text, but it's a very valuable experiment and
looks beautiful when printed in high quality for titling, etc. And yes,
*books* in Helvetica are generally awful.

                     -----------------------------

JK> Serifs have been scientifically shown to be a *lot* easier on the
reader, as they guide the eyes along the lines.

LP-2> In all tests I've seen the serifs have always won the day, but
only with certain seriffed fonts, and fonts like Univers aren't far
behind. The "tracking" advantage for serif fonts is reduced when you're
talking about narrow newspaper/magazine columns.

                     -----------------------------

JK> You wrote a pretty short and partial history of type. Why ignore
the roots of type (blackletter) as well as the climax (moderns-give an
explanation) and subsequent 'post-modern' revivals?

LP-2> I was just talking about the place the 3 most common DTP types
hold in the history of typography, and a few associated pitfalls. It
wasn't meant as a "history of typography" at all. Please feel free to
provide such a history yourself.

JK> I think any short list of specific faces is incomplete without
mention of Palatino, the most popular Old Style revival in existence.

LP-2> Do you? To my mind Palatino is grossly over used. You must agree
it looks bad for dense text. It isn't a proper "oldstyle revival" at
all, more of a "calligraphic interpretation" of it. Zapf designed it as
a display face, and wasn't too concerned about lining up the serifs
(check out the "t"). And it just *has* to be printed on 1200dpi devices
(at least) to look good in small sizes. OK then, maybe a short list is
incomplete without a caution NOT to use Palatino...

JK> Also, if this is meant to be a "quick history/user guide for those
fairly new to using fonts on desktop publishing systems," then I would
recommend more directions about the proper uses of certain faces (e.g.,
Goudy for shaped text, Peignot for display *only*) and styles (e.g.,
italics for editorial comments, all-caps for basically nothing).

LP-2> Okay, okay. I was only sharing a few ideas, not trying to write a
book. Surely you agree that the 3 typefaces I chose are by far the most
commonly used and abused these days? I don't think a discussion of
Goudy or Peignot fits in very well here, unless we're hoping to make a
very wide-ranging FAQL. Regarding styles: first, italics are used
principally for *emphasis* (rather than bold in running text); second,
all good books have a few small caps here and there, don't they? - all
mine do...

JK> Sorry if I come across as critical. I think the idea of making a
FAQL is a good one, as is your effort. We just have to make sure it
doesn't give any newbies the wrong impressions and further perpetuate
the typographical morass we're facing today.

LP-2> Sorry if I come across as defensive, but I stand by what I said
and object to the suggestion that I am "perpetuating the typographical
morass". (I don't know if you really intended this - apologies if you
didn't.)

Comments by Don Hosek:
======================

Don Hosek offers the following additional notes:

The "Times" in most printers is actually a newer version of the font
than Monotype's "Times New Roman" which it is originally based on.
Walter Tracy's _Letters of Credit_ gives an excellent history of the
face which was based on Plantin and in the original cutting has metrics
matching the original face almost exactly. Another interesting note
about the face is that it is almost a completely different design in
the bold: this is due to the fact that old-styles are difficult to
design as a bold. Incidentally, the classification of Times as a
transitional is not firm. It likely is placed there by some type
taxonomists (most notably Alexander Lawson) because of the bold and a
few minor features. Others, myself included, think of it as a old
style. The typeface listed in the Adobe catalog as Times Europa was a
new face commissioned in 1974 to replace the old Times (whose 50th
birthday was this past October 3rd).

Hermann Zapf is not particularly pleased with any of the
phototypesetting versions of Optima. As a lead face, Optima is very
beautiful. His typeface "World", used in the World Book Encyclopedia is
one recutting for photocomp which improves the font somewhat. He is on
record as saying that if he had been asked, he would have designed a
new font for the technology.

Pronounciation of Font Names
****************************

Below each of the following font names, a suggested English
pronounciation is given.  This information was collected from a
(relatively) long discussion on comp.fonts.  If you disagree, or have
other suggestions, please let me know.

Arnold Boecklin
===============

"Ar" as in car, "nold" as in "old" with an "n" on the front.  "Boeck"
is tricker.  The "oe" is actually an umlaut "o" in German, and the
closest sound to most English speakers is an "er".  So try "Berklin" if
you want to come close to the original.  Otherwise, just say "Boklin",
with a long o, like in "boat".

Benguiat
========

Ben-Gat.  This according to an ITC brochure.

Courier
=======

I would pronounce Courier not like Jim Courier, but the French way:
Ku-rie, where "Ku" is pronounced like "coo", only short, and "rie" is
pronounced "ree-eh".

Didot
=====

Stressed at the last syllable. "Dee-DOOH" (not nasal).

Fette Fraktur
=============

"Fet" as in "get" with a "te" that rhymes with "way".  "Frak" rhymes
with "mock", and "tur" with "tour".

Fenice
======

Feh-nee'-chey

Garamond
========

"Gara-": Use a french "r" instead of an english one. Both "a"s are
pronounced like the "u" in the word "up". "-mond": the last syllable is
stressed, and you don't pronounce the "n" and "d", but the whole "ond"
is a nasal "o". Hold your nose closed and say "Ooh", then you get the
right sound.  The "ant" in "Avant-Garde" is very similar to this sound,
it is a nasal situated between "a" and "o".

Helvetica
=========

Hell-veh'-ti-ka

Koch Roman
==========

Pronounced like scottish `Loch', but with K instead of L.

LaTeX
=====

Lamport lists lah'-tech, lah-tech', lay'-tech and lay'-tecks as valid
on p.4.  Last I talked to him he'd settled into lay'-tech which has
always been my pronunciation as well. Somewhere, I heard that LL does
explicitly rule out L.A.-tech, but he's from northern California which
explains a lot.

Mos Eisley
==========

moss eyes-lee

Novarese
========

No-vahr-ay'-zay

Palatino
========

pa-la-TEEN-oh

Peignot
=======

There's some contention here, suggested pronouncations:

pay-nyoh'

"P" like "P" in `Post", "ei" like "a" in "fan", "gn" like "n" in "noon"
plus "y" in "yes", "ot" - long, closed "o" (I don't know English
examples), stressed.

"P" like "P" in `Post", "ei" like "a" in "many", "gn" like "n" in
"noon" plus "y" in "yes", "ot" - long, closed "o" (I don't know English
examples), stressed.

Sabon
=====

Sah-bon'

TeX
===

Rhymes with Blech, (as in "Blech, that tasted awfull!")

Veljovic
========

Vel'-yo-vitch

Zapf
====

Like "tsapf".  The "a" is pronounced like a short version of the well
known tongue-depresser vowel "aaahhh".  Perhaps a better English analogy
would be the "o" in "hop" or "hops".
