Notes on how to share bibtex files.

Construction of citation keys:

@article
	Author:<abbrev-journal>-<volume or yyear>-<start page or month#>

@inproceedings
	Author:<abbrev-booktitle><yyear>-<start page> [no -, e.g, RIDT91]

@incollection
	Author:<abbrev-booktitle>-<yyear>-<start page>
        
@proceedings
@book
@...thesis
	Author:<abbrev-title>-<yyear>

@unpublished
	Author:<abbrev-title>-<yyear>-<month# or whatever>

@techreport
	Author:<abbrev-title>-<yyear> or
        Author:<abbrev-inst>-<yyear>-<number>


To make abbrev, use initial letters from the first three or so important
words in the title.  If title has one word, probably better to
abbreviate it than to use just a single letter, as in `SCI' rather than
`S' for the journal `Science'.  For books it probably doesn't matter much.

Use \#, \&, \$
Use \allcaps

journal string prefix	`j-'
publisher		`pub-'
publisher address	`pub-<publisher>:adr'
institution		`inst-'


This book has a good collections of journal abbreviations:
