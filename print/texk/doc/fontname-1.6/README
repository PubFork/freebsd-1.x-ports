This directory contains files regarding a naming scheme for fonts to be
used with TeX.

fontname.texi is a Texinfo document describing the overall scheme.
The other files are the application of that scheme to various sets of
fonts.  (I did the American Mathematical Society and Computer Modern
abbreviations mostly out of curiosity, not because I actually expect
people to run out and use them.)
