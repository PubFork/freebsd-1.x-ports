Here is a list of abbreviations for all American Mathematical Society
fonts as of February 18, 1991, according to the scheme described in
`fontname.tex'.

The symbol fonts don't fit well into the scheme.  Sorry.

Perhaps the University of Washington should get the foundry letter `w';
I'm not sure.  Or perhaps the typeface name should be `Washington
Cyrillic'.  

I believe all the AMS fonts are (essentially) public domain.  For our
purposes, this is fortunate, since `a', `m', and `s' are all taken by
larger foundries.
