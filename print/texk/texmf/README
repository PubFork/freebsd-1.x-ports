This is my basic tex&mf lib distribution.
It provides enough stuff to get going.
Files which are installed by other distributions (e.g., the PostScript
fonts by dvips) are omitted.

There is over 1 gigabyte of additional TeX-related stuff on the
ctan sites:
   pip.shsu.edu:tex-archive
   ftp.tex.ac.uk:pub/archive
   ftp.uni-stuttgart.de:pub/tex
I suggest you look there for more material.

If you have suggestions for additional files that should go in this
distribution, you can email me. But I warn you I plan to be very
conservative about adding things.
