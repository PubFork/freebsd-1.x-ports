\abstract
These Guidelines are for authors of papers being prepared for
presentation at the \MtgYear{} Annual Meeting of the \TUG\ and subsequent
publication in the {\sl Proceedings\/} issue of \TUB.  Their purpose
is to help assure consistency in the presentation of information and in
format.  This is important when discussing \TeX\ because of its
reputation for producing beautiful work.  Sources of information about
\TeX\ and its applications are still few in number, and these {\sl
Proceedings\/} may be expected to occupy a significant place in this
literature.
\endabstract
 
\article
 
\head * Papers *
 
\subhead * Selection and preparation of papers *
 
Papers to be presented at the \TUG\ Annual Meeting are selected by the
Program Committee.  These Guidelines are concerned with preparation of
the papers for distribution as Preprints and for publication in the {\sl
Proceedings\/} of the meeting.  Papers (including the bibliography)
should be around 6~pages in length; in addition to the body of the
paper, examples of input and output may be given in an appendix, for a
total of up to 10~pages in all.
 
Papers are expected to maintain a technical, non-commercial orientation.
Vendors are given the opportunity to introduce their products through
exhibits, and are expected to use that forum for sales presentations and
product demonstrations.  However, technical presentations which deal
with issues of design, implementation and effective use are encouraged.

\subhead * Preliminary version of the paper *
 
Authors should submit {\it two\/} paper copies {\it and\/} the source
file of their text to the editor, at the address above, by the announced
date ({\bf \PrelimDeadline}). Electronic mail is preferred for
transmission of the source; {\SMC DOS} or Macintosh discs can also be
accepted, provided they are in {\SMC ASCII} or text-only format.
Problems may occur with electronic transmission of files, some of which
are discussed in the section Electronic Submission; see below.
 
The paper copies should be on regular paper rather than on
film or high-quality paper because the copy will be marked by the
editor; photocopies are acceptable.  At this stage, art work (graphics
insertions) also should not be originals.
 
As with papers submitted to regular issues of \TUB, each paper to appear
in the {\sl Proceedings\/} will be reviewed by a volunteer competent in
the particular subject area of the paper.  This reviewer will examine
the paper for accuracy, for quality of presentation, and for
non-commercial orientation, and will make suggestions as necessary in
those areas.  The purpose of this review is to achieve a consistent high
quality in all issues of \TUB.  In general, the comments of the reviewer
will be conveyed to the author through the editor, and the reviewer will
remain anonymous.
 
\subhead * Preprints *
 
Once the papers are reviewed and edited, the marked-up paper copy,
revised source file, any suggestions from the reviewer, and a clean
proof copy will be returned to the author.  Suggestions from the
reviewer must be addressed at this time.  Authors will then prepare
their revised versions, and send the new source file (via e-mail if
possible) plus paper copy to the editor, who will arrange for
reproduction of the preprints.  The deadline for receipt of copy for the
preprints by the editor is {\bf \PreprintDeadline}.
 
Papers that do not conform to these Guidelines will encounter delays in
production; authors are therefore urged to prepare their manuscripts
with particular attention to the sections headed Timetable, Format,
Contents, and Macro Packages.
 
The preprints will be made available at the Meeting. The author will be
given another opportunity to refine the paper before publication in the
{\sl Proceedings\/} issue of \TUB.
 
\subsubhead *Technical Note: *
 
Some papers are at the cutting edge of \TeX\ and technology.  Should
typesetting of an article be particularly difficult, the author may be
required to provide camera copy for the Preprints.  In addition, the
article may be moved to a subsequent issue of \TUB, in order not to
delay publication of the {\sl Proceedings}.  The editor will discuss
any difficulties with the author.
 
\subhead * Final version *
 
Following the Meeting, authors may elect to add new or updated
information to their articles, resulting from their presentations and
subsequent discussion with participants at the Meeting.  Camera-ready
copy including final changes, or revised source files, should be
returned directly to the editor prior to the deadline, {\bf
\CameraDeadline}.  To avoid damage, place the material between cardboard
and mark the package ``Do Not Bend!''
 
\head * Timetable *
 
Publication of the {\sl Proceedings\/} of the Annual Meeting requires
adherence to a rigid timetable.  There are several important deadlines
(see box, previous page) which authors have an obligation to meet.
 
Authors should contact the editor, at least 24 hours in advance, if
there is any difficulty in meeting one of the deadlines, so that
alternatives may be explored that will not delay production.
 
\head * Copyright *
 
The {\sl Proceedings\/} will be copyright by the \TUG, with the
actual copyright statement in the spirit of the GNU General
Public License.  That is, permission ``will be granted to make and
distribute verbatim copies [\dots] provided the copyright notice and
[\dots] permission notice are preserved on all copies.''

Authors are encouraged to agree to this form of copyright.
However, any author wishing to retain full personal rights to an
article may do so by including a copyright notice in the article file;
the editor will confirm such a notice with the author.
 
\head * Format *
 
While these Guidelines were prepared with the plain \TeX{} macros,
they describe both the plain \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} commands to be used
to prepare articles for the {\sl Proceedings}.  (The relevant files
are identified in the section Macro Packages, and the source file for
these Guidelines can be used as a model for a plain-based article.)
The {\sl Proceedings\/} macros modify and augment the basic \TUB\/
macros.  The present document describes only the {\sl Proceedings\/}
macros; authors should also consult the article on the basic \TUB{}
macros in Whitney and Beeton (1989).
 
\subhead * Title and author(s) *
 
The text used for the \hbox{|\title|} and |\author| macros will appear
both in the top matter on the first page of the article, and in the
running heads on subsequent pages.  Try to keep titles short, yet
informative; full names are preferred to initials.  If your title
requires, respectively, slant font, italics, or the \MF\ logo, use
|\sl|, |\it|, or |logo10 scaled 1440| (the latter if you have it; if
not, use something similar at that size or rewrite the title); the title
and the running heads should then appear as shown in this document.  If
your title is too long to fit in the running head, use
\verbatim
\shorttitle #1\endshorttitle
\endverbatim
in a plain \TeX{} article or
\verbatim
\shortTitle{...}
\endverbatim
in a \LaTeX{} article to provide an abbreviated version.  If there is
more than one author, use
\verbatim
\shortauthor #1\endshortauthor
\endverbatim
or
\verbatim
\shortAuthor{...}
\endverbatim
for a plain or \LaTeX{} article, respectively,
to provide an appropriate list of them (if necessary, last names only
or, e.g., |Smith, {\it et al.}|).
 
\subhead * Author(s) addresses *
 
These should contain the author's complete mailing address, with
(optional) telephone number and, whenever possible, appropriate
electronic mail addresses (including identification of the network).
The macros involved are |\address| and |\netaddress|.
 
\subhead * Abstract *
 
The abstract should be a quick overview of the article, between 60 and
100 words in length.  It should comprise a summary of the main points of
the paper, with only brief references to the literature, if any.  The
abstracts will be used for translations and summaries to appear
elsewhere.
 
For plain \TeX\ files, use:
\verbatim
\abstract
<text here>
\endabstract
\endverbatim
%
and, for \LaTeX\ files:
\verbatim
\begin{abstract}
<text here>
\end{abstract}
\maketitle
\endverbatim
\LaTeX\ users should remember to insert the abstract {\bf before}
|\maketitle|.
 
Some authors find that a simple way to construct the abstract is to
select key sentences from the article, once it has been written.  It is
essential that the abstract be self-contained:\ include no bibliographic
citations and no footnotes.  (You could mention \TB\ by name, but don't
refer to it using cryptic codes like Knuth (1984), etc.  Leave that kind
of thing for the body of your article.)
 
\subhead * Contents *
 
Articles should be 6--10 pages in length (10pt font on 12pt baseline)\Dash
approximately the equivalent of a 25-minute presentation.  Creation
of headers and footers is, on the whole, automatic.  At the top of your
file include the items listed at the beginning of this one, including
the |\preprint| switch, which substitutes one form of footer for
another.  Comment out the |\preprint| line when final camera copy is
produced.  The actual page numbers for the published {\sl Proceedings\/}
will be pasted on when the files are being prepared by
TUG for the printer.  Authors should try to keep formatting fairly
straightforward.  Cross-referencing, if used, should be to sections and
not to page numbers.
 
\subhead * Bibliography *
 
The {\sl Proceedings\/} serve not only as a record of the Meeting, but
also as a reference document for members unable to attend and for others
who are not members of the \TUG.  Hence authors must not assume their
readers are familiar with even the more commonly cited documents.  All
sources referred to in the body of the article must be properly
identified in the bibliography.  The following paragraphs describe the
content and order of appearance of the various elements, and the format
used to typeset the bibliographic entries.  See previous TUG {\sl
Proceedings\/} for further examples; uniformity and consistency of style
are the main objectives, to the extent possible.
 
\subsubhead * Contents of entries: *
 
Authors' names should be listed in alphabetical order (last name first),
followed by either the full name or initials; in the case of multiple
authors, only the first author's name should be in reverse order.
 
\TUB\/ has a policy of strict adherence to the pattern, established in
\TB, of setting names of books and periodicals in the {\sl slant font\/}
(i.e., |{\sl slant font\/}|).  The names of a number of books and
periodicals which you may have occasion to cite have macros in the file
|tugboat.cmn|,\footnote{$^1$}{{\bf Note:} This file, which contains
macros common to both \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} usage, was previously called
{\tt tugboat.com}; however, in order to avoid confusion with {\SMC DOS}
naming conventions, as well as to better indicate the {\it common\/}
nature of its content, the name has been changed to {\tt tugboat.cmn}.}
including |\TUB| for \TUB, |\TB| for \TB, etc.; other
macros in the file do useful things, such as refining the kerning for
\AW, etc.  Authors are urged to print out the file {\tt tugboat.cmn}
and use it for reference.
 
For articles published in journals, enclose the title of the article in
quotation marks, and use the slant font for the name of the journal.
The volume and issue numbers should be included, as well as the page
range of the article, followed by the year.
 
For articles published in books, put the article title in quotation
marks, followed by the inclusive page numbers, using an en-dash.  The
title of the book should appear in the slant font.  In the case of
edited collections, the editor's name should be included.  Place of
publication is followed by the publisher.  The date is the final element
in the entry.
 
For books, each entry should include the full name(s) of the author(s),
complete title of the book, place of publication and publisher, and date
of publication.
 
For all titles, use capital letters on the main words.  Multiple entries
with the same author(s) should be listed in chronological order.
 
In general, style ``A'', as described in {\sl The Chicago Manual of
Style\/} (pages 438ff), is to be followed; our style diverges with
respect to the position of page ranges for articles within books
(between the article title and that of the book), and the position of
the date for journal articles (end of the entry, as for books).
 
\subsubhead * Format of entries: *
 
|tugproc.sty| contains the macro |\entry|, which sets the individual
bibliographic entries.  Bibliographies prepared with {\tt ltugproc.sty}
should use |\bibitem| as any regular \LaTeX\ file.  Below are some
sample entries (see also {\sl The Chicago Manual of Style\/} for
examples of various types of document references):
 
\medskip
 
\entry{Chen, Peehong, Michael A.~Harrison, Jeffrey W.~McCarrell, John
   Coker, and Steve Procter.  ``An Improved User Environment for \TeX.''
   Pages~32--44 in {\sl \TeX\ for Scientific Documentation}, Jacques
   D\'esarm\'enien, ed.  (Lecture Notes in Computer Science 236).
   Heidelberg: Springer, 1986.}
 
\entry{Knuth, Donald E.  \TB.  Reading, Mass.: \AW, 1984.}
 
\entry{Parks, Berkeley.  ``\TeX\ Tips for Getting Started.'' {\sl \TeX
   niques\/} 7, pages 129--138, 1988.}
 
\entry{Wujastyk, Dominik.  ``The Many Faces of \TeX.  A Survey of
   Digital \MF\ Fonts.'' \TUB\/ 9(2), pages 131--151, 1988.}
 
\medskip
 
When referring to publications in the body of the article, use the
following form for consistency throughout the volume: ``$\ldots$\
according to Knuth (page 420) $\ldots$'', ``$\ldots$\ according to
Knuth (1984, page 420) $\ldots$'', or ``$\ldots$\ according to Knuth
(\TB, page 420) $\ldots$'', where the choice depends on how much is
required for positive identification.  But please do not say ``$\ldots$\
according to (Knuth, page 420)\ $\ldots$''.\footnote{$^2$}{Example of a
footnote.}
 
\subhead * Appendix *
 
Authors who wish to provide samples of input or output that will not
comfortably fit in the two-column format of their articles are
encouraged to put them in an appendix.  An |\appendix| macro is supplied
(in |tugproc.sty|) for the heading; it automatically starts on a new
page and prints the material in a one-column full-width format.  No
special provision has been made yet for appendices in |ltugproc.sty|;
if you require this facility, please notify the editor as soon as
possible.  Recall that the page limit {\it includes\/} any appendix
material.
 
\head * Contents *
 
In the previous section the basic elements of an article were outlined,
from the top matter (title, authors, abstract) to the final items
(bibliography and/or appendix).  This section continues the discussion,
with attention to questions about specific elements in your paper.
 
\subhead * Headings *
 
{\sl Proceedings\/} style allows for up to three levels of headings.
For those using {\tt tugproc.sty}, the macros |\head|, |\subhead|, and
|\subsubhead| are provided; |\endhead| terminates each of these headings.
\LaTeX\ provides |\section{...}|, |\subsection|\hskip0pt\relax|{...}|,
and |\subsubsection{...}|.  The same headings are used in regular issues of
\TUB, except that the first level differs from the \TUB\/ main head, by
using 12 point extended bold instead of the usual 10 point that appears
in ordinary issues.  (These Guidelines illustrate all three levels of
headings.)
 
There is no requirement that any of these headings be used; they are
available if you feel a need for them.  The only constraint is that when
more than one level is used, the hierarchy first-, second-, third-level
should be followed.  Articles which use other forms of headings (e.g.,
with different fonts or positions) will be made consistent with this
style.  The only centered headings used for the {\sl Proceedings\/} are
for the Abstract, titles or captions for tables and figures, and for the
Appendix, if there is one.
 
\smallskip
 
\item{a.}Level-one headings should be in mixed case.  The main
   words in the heading should begin with capitals, but {\it not\/} words
   such as |of|, |on|, |by|, |from|, |the|.  Do not use all capitals!
 
\item{b.}For level-two headings, only the first word should
   begin with a capital. {\tt tugproc.sty} users should omit
   punctuation at the end of this heading; a period will be supplied
   by the macro. Users of {\tt ltugproc.sty} must insert the period.
 
\item{c.}For level-three headings only the first word
   should begin with a capital.  Include punctuation at the end of this
   heading, unless the heading itself contains the first word or so of the
   new paragraph.  No punctuation will be supplied by the macro.
   Paragraphs with this heading are indented.
 
\subhead * Footnotes *
 
Footnotes are for brief comments, not bibliographic information (see the
subsection Bibliography, above).  \TUB\/ style calls for footnotes
referring to the text to be set at 10 point; in plain-based articles
they must be numbered by hand
(|\footnote{$^|$n$|$}|\penalty-2\hskip0pt\relax|{...}|).
Footnotes in tables
and figures should appear immediately below the table or figure, above
the caption.  The footnote flags in tables and figures should be marked
with raised lowercase italic letters; asterisks, daggers, etc., should
be avoided.  Trademark acknowledgements should {\it not\/} be included in
footnotes.  (More on this below.) Other acknowledgements may be made in
the first sentences of the paper, as a footnote, or, if lengthy, kept
for a section at the end of the paper (just before the Bibliography)
using a heading at the appropriate level, e.g., in plain style:
\verbatim
\head * Acknowledgements *
\endverbatim
or the |\subhead| macro if you find you have no need in your article for
a higher level.
%% BARB: I think we discussed something different for the above portion
%%       of text, but I can't make much from my notes... ;-)
%%  my notes say to make a change to tugproc.sty to autonumber footnotes;
%%  afraid i'm not going to have time to get to that for this year.
 
\subhead * Verbatim \TeX\ code *
 
When source code is to be represented in the article, verbatim
techniques should be used.  There are differences between plain \TeX\
and \LaTeX\ verbatim techniques, which will be explained separately.
Remember that displayed verbatim text will reflect the line breaks of
the input file, and will be set in the |\tt| font.  Vertical space above
and below the displayed verbatim text will be inserted automatically.
 
If you desire particular visual effects in your verbatim text (e.g.,
column effects or indented macro continuation lines in macro
definitions), use spaces and {\it not\/} tabs, which may hamper
electronic transmission of your file (see section below) and will, in
any case, not yield the desired results.
 
Extensive listings of files should be assigned to the Appendix, where
they will be set one column per page.  Use headings such as
``Listing~1'', etc., for identification.  Please consider using smaller
type, as discussed below, which might save space and paper.  Passages in
verbatim displays break automatically between columns and pages.
 
\subsubhead * Plain \TeX\ ({\tt tugproc.sty}): *
 
|\verbatim| and |\endverbatim| are provided for displayed verbatim text.
There is an automatic indent from the left margin.  Initial spaces in
the first line are ignored unless the null-switch is used:\
|\verbatim[]|).
 
If the text following displayed verbatim text is the continuation of the
paragraph above the display, do not leave a blank line.  A blank line
will cause the automatic paragraph indent to be activated.
 
For short verbatim items in text (``in-line verbatim''), simply enclose
the item between a pair of vertical bars, for example:\
\verbatim[\inline]|verbatim|\endverbatim.
 
You might consider using the |\smallcode| switch to reduce a verbatim
example to 9pt, in order to make a long line fit the narrow column,
and/or to save space overall.\endgraf
||
\verbatim[\smallcode]
This is nine point code.
\endverbatim
||
which will produce type of the following size
\verbatim[\smallcode]
This is nine point code.
\endverbatim
instead of this size:
\verbatim
This is ten point code.
\endverbatim
 
If a significant portion of your displayed verbatim text requires this
smaller size, it is better to use |\everyverbatim| for consistency:\endgraf
% bug in parsing of verbatim options applies baselineskip of \smallcode
% to preceding text; avoid problem by ending the paragraph
\verbatim[\smallcode]
\everyverbatim{\displaystyle{\smallcode}}
\endverbatim
This is placed at the top of your text file (or wherever you want it to
take effect), which avoids having to switch the size for each individual
display.
 
\subsubhead * \LaTeX\ ({\tt ltugproc.sty}): *
 
Displayed verbatim text uses the usual verbatim macro environment:
|\begin{verbatim}| and |\end{verbatim}|.
 
If the displayed verbatim text is to be followed by a continuation of the
paragraph, don't leave a blank line.  A blank line will activate the
usual paragraph indent.
 
For in-line verbatim text, use the |\verb+...+| construction (almost any
character can be used as matching delimiters; see the \LaTeX\ manual,
pp.\ 65--66, 168).
 
Where verbatim material is either too long for the line or there is a
need to conserve space, enclose the verbatim environment in a |\small|
group, as shown below:
 
\verbatim
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Your text
On these lines
\end{verbatim}
}
\endverbatim
 
\subhead * Figures and tables *
 
It is left to authors to decide where to place figures and tables; these
may be inserted in the text, or gathered together in an appendix.
Captions should be centered; table captions should appear above, and
figure captions below their respective elements:
$$
   \hbox{Figure~1: Sample of new font |cmxxfr|}
$$
 
\subhead * Special effects *
 
Special effects include traditional art work (photographs, diagrams,
etc.), which must be pasted into space left for that purpose.  Special
effects may also include special font work, or \PS\ material which can
be provided in electronic form.  All three types require special
handling.
 
\subsubhead * Art work: *
 
If physical art work is required, photocopies only should be submitted
with the preliminary version for preparation of preprints.  Do not send
originals.  Originals should be sent only when submitting the final
version (after presentation at the Annual Meeting).
 
Inserts (including photographs) should be clear\-ly identified on the
back (and for photographs, especially, very carefully, at the edge),
e.g., ``Fig.~1''; their location in the text should also be shown
explicitly.
 
\subsubhead * Special fonts: *
 
If your paper requires fonts which are not generally available, please
indicate this clearly to the editor.  You will most likely be asked to
supply the \MF\ source(s).  Additional time and effort may be required
to process your paper; final output for the {\sl Proceedings\/} will be
prepared on a phototypesetter and unexpected effects have appeared in
the past when fonts have not previously been tested at typesetter
resolutions.  This testing must commence soon after receipt of the
preliminary version, in order to resolve any potential problems.
 
\subsubhead * PostScript and other graphics inser\-tions: *
 
\PS\ and other graphics have been included successfully in \TUB\/ issues,
including the {\sl Proceedings}.  However, the author must inform the
editor about such special elements.  As with special fonts, testing
must be done as early as possible, in order to avoid unexpected problems
at later stages of production.
 
With respect to \PS\ material, encapsulated \PS\ is the only form of
\PS\ files that can be processed.  Ask for the {\tt epsf.sty} file from
the editor.
 
If using a non-\PS\ graphics program to generate non-text material,
clearly identify the program (correct file names, version number,
equipment and working environments).  Make a special note to the editor
that your article requires these additional items, which you may be
asked to submit along with the electronic file of your preliminary
version.
 
If problems encountered cannot be solved in a timely manner, the author
may be asked to provide clean camera copy (300dpi minimum).  This may be
unavoidable for the preprints; an effort will be made to solve any such
problems before final publication in the {\sl Proceedings}.
 
\subhead * Spelling conventions *
 
Spelling consistency covers both common words and accepted spellings of
commercial products.  Authors are advised to look at various \TeX\
publications, including \TB\ and issues of \TUB, for general guidance.
See also the Appendix for some pertinent spelling conventions.  Many
items of this kind may be invoked easily using macros in the file
|tugboat.cmn|, which is included in the macro package.  The main
question here is consistency.  Either British or American spelling is
acceptable; pick one and stick with it.
 
When two words describe a third (``left-justified text''), there is
frequently a hyphen between the first two.  {\sl The Chicago Manual of
Style\/} (1982) has a fairly extensive set of guidelines on dealing with
such noun phrases (pages~176--181), which authors may find useful.
The third edition of {\sl Words into Type\/} (1974) also has a good
section (pages~223--239).
 
Do not use |---| for em-dashes.  Use {\tt\char'134{Dash}\char'040}
instead.  This inserts thin spaces before and after the dash, and
provides proper control at line breaks.
 
By the way, in \TUB, commas, etc., do not go inside quotes unless they
are part of what is being quoted.
 
\subhead * Trademark acknowledgements *
 
Since the {\sl Proceedings\/} are part of the regular \TUB\/ series,
there is no need to acknowledge trademarks\Dash these are covered in a
general statement at the front of the issue.  Authors are therefore
asked {\it not\/} to include such information either in the text or in
footnotes.  If a product name is newly trademarked or may not be known
to the editors, this fact may be conveyed in a comment or a covering
message to the editor.
 
\subhead * Font use *
 
Font use should be consistent, and restrained.  In other words, as
with headings and footnotes, your use of fonts should be limited to
what is essential to your exposition.  The following conventions are
suggested:
 
\smallskip
 
\item{a.}{\it Italics}, rather than {\bf boldface}, should be used for
   emphasis; the {\sl slant\/} font {\it could\/} also be used, but is
better reserved for names of books and periodicals.  Never use
underlining.  Use italic corrections (|\/|) where appropriate.
Italics should not be used for titles of articles; see section on
Bibliography.
 
\item{b.}The |typewriter| or |teletype| font (|\tt|) should be used for
   macro names or anything else to be keyed in, and will often include
the backslash character (e.g., |\entry|); font names should also be in
this font (e.g., |cmr12|).  These examples are produced by using the
appropriate verbatim techniques (see the subsection Verbatim \TeX\
code, above). The |\tt| font is automatically used for verbatim text.
See the Appendix to these Guidelines for a list of \TeX-related words
which are customarily set in this font.
 
\item{c.}The {\smc smallcaps} (|\smc|) font may be used if there are
   terms, especially product names, in uppercase (more or less), such as
   {\smc Unix}, {\smc ascii}, {\smc wysiwyg}.  This is, however, a choice
   left to the author.  For these particular examples key |{\smc smallcaps}|,
   |{\smc Unix}|, |{\smc ascii}|, |{\smc wysiwyg}|, respectively.
   Note: \LaTeX's |\sc| is the same as |\smc|.
 
\item{d.}There are certain font-related conventions for trademarks and
   other citations.  See the Appendix for one list. The file
   {\tt tugboat.cmn}, required for both plain \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ macro
   packages, provides definitions for a number of frequently used terms
   and logos.  If you do not have the \MF\ font (|logo*|), for example,
   use sans serif in an appropriate size; users of the plain \TeX\
   macros can type |{\niness METAFONT}|, to get {\niness
   METAFONT}.\footnote{$^3$}{Sans serif will not
   be available unless the macro |\LoadSansFonts| has been invoked.
   Do not use |\LoadSansFonts| unless needed, as it will occupy memory
   unnecessarily. For an example of its use, see the top of this file
   and {\tt tugboat.sty}.} \LaTeX\ users should use |\sf| if they need it.
 
\head * Electronic submission *
 
Some extra care is required if your file is to be transferred on an
electronic network to or from the editor.  These problems are often the
result of communications problems between different types of computer
systems joined together in the networks.  Among the causes are {\SMC
ASCII}-to-{\SMC EBCDIC} conversions and restrictions on line length in
some mail systems.  Avoiding tabs has already been mentioned; sometimes
they do not travel well and cause delays in processing files.
 
Another problem arises from lines that are too wide.  Some systems along
the net truncate lines which have more than 80 characters and others
simply break such lines (the latter therefore can insert spaces in the
middle of words).  It is safest to set auto-fill or word-wrap at
something fewer than 80 characters (65 to 70 usually works well) and to
be careful to reformat after making insertions.  Finally, avoid placing
a period at the beginning of any line, as in some systems this indicates
the end of a file, and everything following will be lost.
 
\head * Macro Packages *
 
The following files constitute the macro packages for {\sl
Proceedings\/} of the Annual Meeting and are distributed with these
Guidelines ({\tt guidepro.tex}), which use the three plain \TeX\ files
listed first:
\verbatim
tugboat.sty   \ use with plain.tex
tugproc.sty   / use with plain.tex
tugboat.cmn   - use with BOTH
                plain and latex
ltugboat.sty  \ use with latex.tex
ltugproc.sty  / use with latex.tex
\endverbatim
The three {\tt *tugboat} files are described in Whitney and Beeton
(1989).  The remaining two ({\tt *tugproc}) files contain supplementary
\TeX\ and \LaTeX\ macros for the {\sl Proceedings\/} issue of \TUB.
 
If there are any macros that you define yourself for use in your paper,
but whose definitions you do not print in the article (including its
appendix), their definitions should be incorporated near the top of your
source file.
 
If some of your macros are both listed and used, they should be put into
a separate file which is |\input| at the top of your text file, {\it as
well as\/} read in when it is to be listed, cf.\ |\verbfile| in Whitney
and Beeton (1989, page 380).  At this writing, no \LaTeX{} equivalent has
yet been installed; please notify the editor as soon as possible if you
need this facility.
 
This output was produced by processing the file {\tt guidepro.tex} with
{\tt tugproc.sty}, {\tt tugboat.sty}, and {\tt tugboat.cmn}.  A listing
of |guidepro.tex| may be used as a model for authors using the plain
\TeX\ macros.  For example, how was the next heading divided into two
lines? The article by Whitney and Beeton has further details on
use of the {\tt *tugboat} files.

Any questions regarding any of these files should be directed to the
editor.
 
\head * Updating your Article\\ after Presentation *
 
Following presentation of your paper at the Annual Meeting, you may wish
to add information, or report on responses to it.  Rather than
incorporate these changes in the body of the article, you may find it
simpler just to add a new section, ``Update'', for such additions.  Use
the appropriate heading level.

The following article should be required reading for every person
interested in computer composition, not only for its contents and
references to the literature, but especially because it demonstrates how
much one may achieve with a minimum of fancy features (fonts, format,
etc.), each of which presents risks for impeding comprehension.

\head * Typographic Representation *
In addition to the following, consult previous {\sl Proceedings\/} and
other \TeX-related documents. It is also strongly recommended that
authors print out a copy of the file {\tt tugboat.cmn}, which contains
many already defined macros for logos and commonly used names.
(Some of these are listed below.)
