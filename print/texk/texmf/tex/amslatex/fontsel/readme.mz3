Please do not request updates directly from us.


This is a preliminary release of the new font selection scheme and its
interface to LaTeX 2.09.  Please excuse the terseness of the documentation. 


1) Basic macros for setting up a new format file:

basefont.tex    File used during generation of format.  See nfss.tex.
 
fontdef.max     File containing font/shape definitions for standard TeX fonts
                as well as nonstandard fonts like the AMS symbol fonts, etc.
                You need a TeX with a large value for the pool size to use
                this file.

fontdef.ori     File containing font/shape definitions for the standard 
                TeX fonts which are needed to set up a LaTeX format 
                compatible with the old font selection.

lfonts.new      File that should be used instead of the old lfonts.tex to
                set up a new LaTeX format.  See nfss.tex.
        
preload.min     File that preloads the absolute minimum of fonts.  May be
                used during initex run.

preload.med     File that preloads those fonts which are otherwise loaded
                by LaTeXs \documentstyle command if 10pt size is requested.
                If you normally use 11pt or 12pt as a style option you
                shouldn't use this file but make a similar one.  May be
                used during initex run. 

preload.ori     File that preloads more or less the same fonts as the old
                lfonts.tex.  May be used during initex run.



2) Sub styles for the new font selection scheme: 

euscript.sty    Style to set up a math alphabet identifier to access the
                Euler script fonts.

margid.sty      Makes math alphabet identifiers behave like commands with
                one argument, i.e. use \cal{A} as syntax.

newlfont.sty    Switches to new font selection if oldlfont is default.
                See article.

nomargid.sty    Makes math alphabet identifiers behave like font switches,
                i.e. use {\cal A} as syntax.

oldlfont.sty    Switches to old font selection if newlfont is default.
                See article.

syntonly.sty    Defines \syntaxonly command which can then be used in the
                preample to suppress output (TeX will run \approx 4 times
                faster).

tracefnt.sty    Defines \tracingfonts integer. This is used to trace
                font switches etc.  Setting \tracingfonts to <number> in the
                preamble means:

                1       Warnings are turned into error messages to show you
                     the exact location of the problem.
                2       Additionally, loading of external fonts are shown.
                3       Additionally, switching of text fonts is traced. 
                     You will see a lot of information if you set
                     \tacingfonts this high.


3) Example files and documentation:

array.sty       The extension of the array and tabular environment
                as described in tugboat 9#3. This file is without
                documentation and not necessarily up to date. It is
                provided only to run nfss.tex. If you have a newer
                version of array.sty use it instead.

concrete.doc    Unfinished style option which should serve as an
                example of how to use a style file to make new fonts
                known to the new font selection scheme.  This file is
                subject to changes!!

concrete.sty    Stripped down version of concrete.doc without comments.

nfss.bug        This file contains a list of known problems, solved and
                unsolved.

nfss.tex        Article published in TUGboat 11#1 about the LaTeX
                interface to the new font selection scheme.  You will not
                be able to run it successfully through LaTeX unless you
                happen to have a new format and the Concrete and Euler
                Math Fonts available. 
        
                Note that due to a misunderstanding 2 pages of the
                article are missing in TUGboat 11#1.  Therefore the whole
                article is reprinted in TUGboat 11#2. Unfortunately this
                version got a few errors reinserted which had been corrected
                for the first printing (that's life).

nfssinst.tex    The part of nfss.tex (with some extensions) that describes 
                the generation of a new format. It is processable by the 
                old LaTeX.

nfssprob.tex    User problem reports, during installation and/or use
                of the NFSS (New Font Selection Scheme). Usually with
                solutions.
                We only maintain and distribute this file. If you have
                a problem (and hopefully a solution to it) and you think
                this could be of interest to others, please send us your
                contribution as an update to this file. We then distribute
                it in the next release.

readme.mz       File that describes distribution restrictions and gives
                a short overview about other distributions from Mainz.

readme.mz3      This file.


4) Changes not covered in the article nfss.tex:

The files fam.tex, latinit.tex and setsize.tex have been removed and their
contents merged directly into lfonts.new. 

basefnt.tex was renamed to basefont.tex.

\family, \series, \shape and \size have been renamed to \fontfamily,
\fontseries, fontshape and \fontsize. The old names are still supported.
Nevertheless, please use the new names in new applications.


5) Generation of a new format (see also nfssinst.tex):

5.1)   Copy all files to a directory where TeX can find them.
5.2)   Rename the standard lfonts.tex to something like lfonts.old.
5.3)   Start IniTeX using lplain.
5.3.1) Use lfonts.new as a substitute for lfonts.tex
5.3.2) Use fontdef.ori as a substitute for fontdef.tex
5.3.3) Use preload.ori as a substitute for preload.tex
5.3.3) Use oldlfont.sty as a substitute for xxxlfont.sty
5.4)   Say \dump at the end of the run.

This should generate a new format which behaves exactly like the old
one, except, of course, that styles and files which use internals of the
old lfonts.tex (like \xpt or \tenrm) won't work without changes.

This format should enable you to process nfss.tex in a way that it
looks like the original article.  However, we added some additional code
to the document so that it is also processable without making a new
format.  This document will tell you more about the font selection
scheme and how it can be customized to the needs of your installation. 

If you have the concrete fonts you should uncomment the following two
lines:
   
  *  The line in the \documentstyle command where the concrete style is
     loaded 

  *  The line following directly after the \begin{document}, namely

       % \fontfamily{ccr}\fontsize{10}{13pt}\selectfont

You should also comment out this one 

     \fontfamily{cmss}\fontsize{10}{13pt}\selectfont

The unchanged document will produce the article using Computer Modern
sans serif fonts.  Please don't change the file in other respects.  If
you have problems running it, make a copy and change the copy.  I'm
sorry that the preamble of this file contains so many definitions but I
didn't find the time so far to clean things up.  It a real life document
with all editor changes,author remarks, etc. 
 
Last remark: you will need ltugboat.sty and tugboat.com.  They are
distributed together with multicol.doc and doc.sty in the multicol
package.  If you don't have these files it is still possible to produce
the documentation: comment out the ltugboat option and scroll the errors
that will follow.  Of course, some things will be missing or look
different. 

Good luck!


The \fileversion and \filedate lines below are generated so that you can
easily check differences from your version by using GREP or DIFF etc.

Don't be surprised when some files show several version numbers.  The
reason is that these files are generated from several source files (with
the docstrip.tex program), and every source file includes its own
version and date line.
