TeXdraw, as distibuted, is designed to work with the dvips dvi to
PostScript driver.  The graphics inclusion part of TeXdraw has been
successfully ported to use the OzTeX and ArborText drivers.

First, the general information on porting TeXdraw from the TeXdraw
manual is repeated here.  Following that, specific information for
OzTeX and ArborText is included.


How TeXdraw merges graphics and text
====================================

   An understanding of the mechanism used by TeXdraw to put text and
graphics together is useful for porting TeXdraw to other dvi to
PostScript drivers.  The final result of a sequence of TeXdraw commands
will be placed within a TeX box.  Both the graphics from the
intermediate PostScript file and the TeX text will be placed in that
box.

   The graphics file that has been created by TeXdraw has the graphics
contained within a box with lower lefthand corner at PostScript
coordinates given by `\llxbp' and `\llybp'.  These are integer values
in PostScript native units, referred to in TeX as big points (bp). 
There are 72 bp to one inch.

   A simplified version of the code to place graphics and text appears
below.
     \vbox {\vskip \vdrawsize
            \special {psfile=\psfile\space  % graphics file
                      hoffset=\the\llxbp\space
                      voffset=\the\llybp}
            \vskip \llypos
            \hbox {\hskip -\llxpos
                   \box\txdbox              % TeX text
                   \hskip \llxpos}
                   \hskip \hdrawsize
            \vskip -\llypos}}
In this code fragment, a TeX `\vbox' is placed at the current
position on the page.  The size of this box is the drawing size
(`\vdrawsize' high and `\hdrawsize' wide).

   After moving down vertically in the `\vbox' by the height of the
box, the position for the `\special' command is at the bottom lefthand
corner of the box.  The PostScript graphics contained in the file
`\psfile' will be placed at this location.  With no further offset,
this would place the origin of the PostScript space at that point. 
However, the drawing has the lower lefthand corner at the PostScript
position given by the PostScript coordinates `\llxbp' and `\llybp'. 
The `\special' command instructs the dvi to PostScript driver to offset
the graphics by this amount.  In this code, the dvi to PostScript
driver is being asked to do the shifting.  An alternate approach is
shift the position within TeX before invoking the `\special' command. 
In fact, moving the `\special' command to immediately precede the TeX
text placement command (`\box\txdbox') results in the shifting being
performed within TeX.

   The TeX text to be overlaid on the TeXdraw graphics is contained in
a box (box `\txdbox') of zero size, with the text extending outside
this box.  The reference point for this box is TeXdraw coordinate `(0
0)', so this box must be shifted to place the text correctly.  This is
done by temporarily shifting the position both horizontally and
vertically, placing the box, and then restoring the position.  The
shift amounts, `\llxpos' and `\llypos', are TeX dimensions
corresponding to the PostScript coordinate values `\llxbp' and `\llybp'.

=========================================================
OzTeX:

The OzTeX manual clearly states that in-line PostScript cannot be used
reliably to to things like text rotation -- \vtext will not work.

However the other features will work with the \special code changed as
follows.

\special{\p@sfile\space \the\l@lxbp\space \the\l@lybp\space translate}

Within a \special OzTeX takes a file name and optional PostScript code to
be executed before inserting the PostScript code from the file.  Here,
the PostScript code following the file name does the appropriate shifting
of the drawing.

ArborText:

W. J. Metzger (u632111%hnykun11.bitnet@utcs.utoronto.ca) suggests
replacing the \special with

\insertp@{\p@sfile}{\the\l@lxbp}{\the\l@lybp}
%
% to insert the PostScript file using \special
%
%           #1: PostScript file name
% parameter #2: Offset from left margin
%           #3: Offset from bottom of page
% for the  Rokicki dvips driver
%
%\def\insertp@#1#2#3{\special{ps: plotfile #1\space
%                                 hoffset=#2\space
%                                 voffset=#3}}
%
% for the ArborText dvips driver

\def\insertp@#1#2#3{%
       \special{ps::[asis,begin]
          0 SPB
          /figsave save def

          #2 50 mul #3 50 mul translate
          }
       \special{ps: plotfile #1}
       \special{ps::[asis,end]
          grestore
          figsave restore
          0 SPE}
 }
