This file describes the contents of the distribution for TeXdraw

The TeXdraw package consists of a set of macro definitions for the TeX
typesetting program.  These macros allow the user to produce PostScript
drawings from within TeX.

The main benefits of TeXdraw accrue from the ability to produce drawings
from <within> TeX, using TeX fonts for labelling the drawing.

TeXdraw interfaces with the dvips (dvi to PostScript) print program.

Basic drawing features include:
(1) moves, lines and arrow vectors
    - selectable gray level, line width pattern, arrowhead size and type
(2) circles, ellipses, arcs, and Bezier curves
(3) general fill command to fill a region defined by lines and Bezier
    curves (selectable gray level)
(4) TeX text, including mathematics, can be positioned and superimposed
    on the drawing

TeXdraw has been designed to be extensible.  Drawing "segments" are
relocatable, self-contained units.  Using a combination of the begingroup/
endgroup mechanism in TeX and the gsave/grestore mechanism in PostScript,
drawing segments allow for local changes to the scaling and line
parameters.  Using TeX's macro definition capability, new drawing commands
can be constructed from drawing segments.

The extensibility features include,
(1) relocatable drawing segments to keep changes local
(2) local segment scaling
(3) saving and restoring positions using symbolic positions

The compressed file texdraw-V1R5.tar.Z is available for anonymous ftp on
aldebaran.EE.McGill.CA in directory /pub/texdraw.

auxiliary macros, and the TeXdraw manual (texinfo format, also as a

===============================================
The following notes on setup are Unix oriented.

Initial Tests:

(1) Print the PostScript version of the manual ("texdraw.ps") to see the
    capabilities of TeXdraw.  This is a large file which will waste large
    amounts of paper if printed on a non-PostScript printer.  You must have
    a PostScript printer.  Typically, the file can be printed with
    % lpr texdraw.ps
(2) Try TeX'ing the examples file.  Assuming plain TeX is invoked with the
    command "tex",
    % tex txdexamp
(3) Make sure you have dvips by Tom Rokicki as your dvi to PostScript
    driver program.  The \special syntax generated by the TeXdraw macros
    may not be compatible with other converter programs.  Try printing the
    examples.
    % dvips txdexamp

=====
Permanent Setup:

Compact source files:
In the subdirectory "compact", there are versions of the macro files
with most comments and white space removed.

(1) Private copy of TeXdraw.
    Move the TeXdraw sources files ("texdraw.tex", "txdtools.tex" and
    "txdps.tex") to an appropriate directory.  If you are keeping private
    versions of the files, consider the directory ~mylogin/tex . With many
    versions of TeX, setting your default path variable (the environment
    variable TEXINPUTS) to include this directory allows you to refer to
    the files in TeX without specifying the full pathname.  With the
    c-cshell, a line in the ".login" file sets the environment variable
    TEXINPUTS

    setenv TEXINPUTS ".:$HOME/tex:".
    
    The last part of the path string should terminate with a colon to have
    the default directory of public TeX files available.
(2) Public copy of TeXdraw.
    Move the TeXdraw source files ("texdraw.tex", "txdtools.tex" and
    "txdps.tex") to a directory that TeX searches by default.  This
    might be a directory such as "/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs".  Newer
    versions of TeX allow subdirectory searching - this keeps things
    organized.  In that case, use "/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs/TeXdraw".

=====
The following instructions pertain to installing the ability to use the
Texinfo system for any texinfo type manual.
(1) The GNU program "texindex" should built using
    % cc texindex.c -o texindex
    Move the program to an appropriate place such as "/usr/local/bin".
(2) The GNU script "texi2dvi" runs TeX and texindex for a texinfo file.
    Move this script to an appropriate place such as "/usr/local/bin".
(3) The GNU "texinfo.tex" file should go into the public directories
    searched by TeX, for instance "/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs", (or
    "/usr/local/lib/tex/inputs/texinfo" if you have a version of TeX which
    searches subdirectories).

=====
Creating a TeXdraw manual from the sources:
(1) Make sure "texdraw.tex", "txdtools.tex" and "texinfo.tex" will be found
    by TeX.
(2) To create the manual, you have to TeX the manual twice - the second
    time to access the sorted indices and the cross-references.  The
    program "texindex" sorts the indices.  (The distribution includes pre-
    sorted indices that can be used).  The three steps can be replaced by
    an invokation of the script "texi2dvi".
    % tex texdraw.texinfo
    % texindex texdraw
    % tex texdraw.texinfo
(3) Try printing some part of the newly created manual.  The Texinfo macros
    use standard fonts at not-so standard magnifications.  As a result
    dvips may have to run Metafont to create the new font bit-maps.  To
    print part of the manual, say pages 29 and 30, use the command,
    % dvips -p 29 -l 30 texdraw
(4) If you use the GNU emacs editor, the file texdraw.texi can find a
    permanent home in the directory, "/usr/local/emacs/man" or
    its equivalent on your system.

=====
On-line info manual:

Consider building an info version of the manual.  For this you need the
GNU program "makeinfo" (available by anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu
as part of texinfo-2.16.tar.Z).  After running "makeinfo texdraw", the top
level info directory file "dir" in /usr/local/emacs/info needs to be
updated to include a menu entry for TeXdraw.  This entry is of the form
* TeXdraw: (texdraw).
		TeXdraw is a collection of macros that allow drawings to be
                created from within TeX.
Also the files produced by makeinfo (texdraw, texdraw-1, texdraw-2, and
texdraw-3) need to be moved there.  The info file can be read from within
the emacs editor, or with the info reader program "info" (also part of the
texinfo-2.16 distribution).
