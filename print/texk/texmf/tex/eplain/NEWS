This file records noteworthy changes.

2.6 (2 May 1994)
* Indexing support (in conjunction with MakeIndex).
* Generalization of .toc files for lists of figures/tables, etc.
* \commdiag and other arrow macros work again.
* \eqalignno right-justifies the first column in \leftdisplays, as in
  non-leftdisplays.

2.5 (31 March 1994)
* Do not ignore first \ref command.
* Make \verbatim (and the || feature) work again (thanks to Dorai Sitaram).

2.4 (16 March 1994)
* \catcode of @ properly restored (reported by adam@symcom.math.uiuc.edu).
* `| ' in \verbatim argument documented (also reported by adam).
* | not hardwired as the \verbatim escape character (thanks to
  dorai@cs.rice.edu).
* Defining \noarrow before eplain.tex is read omits arrow macros
  (suggested by Rex Shudde <0024P@NAVPGS.BITNET> and
  murray@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au.)
* Double column macros revamped (thanks to guichard@fermat.whitman.edu) so
  \singlecolumn can be invoked on the same page as \doublecolumns.
  3- and 4-column typesetting also supported.
  Column ejects also supported (sort of).
* \parskip set to zero before each footnote (but not for the footnote text).
* \ref and \cite conflicts with amstex described in manual.

2.3 (1 March 1993)

* New macros for arbitrary cross-references.
* \iterate is redefined to allow \else in loops.
* texnames.sty uses \spacefactor1000 instead of an empty hbox to handle
  \TeX at the end of a sentence.
* New macros for hooks and properties.
* \centereddisplays and \leftdisplays can be repeated, and called in any
  order.
* New macros \csn and \ece to do common expansion things.

2.2 (11 November 1992)
* New \toks register \everylist, expanded at the start of every list.
* \footnoterulewidth defined as 2in, not 2true in, thus allowing the use
  of \mag after reading eplain.tex.  The `2true in' was Knuth's, but I
  don't know why he did it.
* \obeywhitespace works inside a \vbox.
* \boxit is \long, and uses \ehrule and \evrule.
* \writenumberedtocentry expands the chapter number, so `\the
  <register>' can be used.
* \verbatim doesn't begin and end with \par, so it can be used in the
  middle of a paragraph.
* \pathafterhook added to \path in path.sty, so macros can execute
  cleanup actions.
* The \path command and friends are documented in the manual.
