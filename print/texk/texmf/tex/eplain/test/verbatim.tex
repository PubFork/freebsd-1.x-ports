\input eplain

Leading spaces:

\verbatim
---T--T----
One

   Two

      Three

   Four

Five
|endverbatim

The same again with spaces on empty lines:

\verbatim
---T--T----
One
   
   Two
   
      Three
   
   Four
   
Five
|endverbatim

Now for some tabs:

\verbatim
--------T-------T
One

	Two

		Three

	Four

Five
	
|endverbatim

Here is how you can get vertical bars into verbatim:

\verbatim
||!@#$%^&*()_-+=\~`{}[]:'';'<>?,./
|endverbatim

And here's you can use it in a paragraph:
\verbatim middle%%%%|endverbatim.  And this is the example from the
manual, quoted with a leading space: `\verbatim| ||\#%&!|endverbatim'.

Now we change the escape character to @ and have a leading space:
\verbatimescapechar @
`\verbatim@ @@|my what big teeth you have!@endverbatim'.

\bye
