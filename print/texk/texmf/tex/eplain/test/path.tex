% Test the \path macro.

\input eplain
%\input path.sty

This is a normal path: \path|karl@cs.umb.edu|.  This is a somewhat
longer path: \path|letters@kropotkin.gnu.ai.mit.edu|.  This is a still
longer path:
\path|megan@agroecology.university-of-california-at-santa-cruz.edu|. I'm
making this all one paragraph so the path macro will have a chance to
show its stuff.  This path has dollar signs and other strange characters
(but no vertical bars) in it: \path|#$%^_<>|.  Now I'm going to change
the discretionaries to only be at !'s. \discretionaries|!| Now this path
should break only at !'s: \path|-hello!..from!@@bang!land|.  Now I'm
going to change things so backslash is the delimiter.
\specialpathdelimiterstrue
\path\##hello!there!@.@again!...we!**still!_have!-bangs!\.  That last
was delimited by backslashes, now let's do one that isn't delimited by
backslashes: \path@hi, there!this is fun!@.  I'll go on for a little
while not doing anything in particular, so \TeX\ will have a chance to
break the paragraph nicely. That's all, folks!
