\topmargin = 3in	\leftmargin = 3in
\bottommargin = 3in	\rightmargin = 3in

This is the first line of text.  The top of it should be 3in from the
top of the paper.
\vfill
This is in the middle. The left margin should be three inches, and so
should the right margin (on the whole page, not just here, of course).
\vfill
The last line's baseline should be 3in from the bottom. 
(This page tested assignments that increase the margins.)

\advancetopmargin by -1in	\advanceleftmargin by -1in
\advancebottommargin by -1in	\advancerightmargin by -1in

This is the first line of text.  The top of it should be 2in from the
top of the paper.
\vfill
This is in the middle.  The left and right margins should be two inches
each.
\vfill
The last line's baseline should be 2in from the bottom. 
(This page tested advances that decreased the margins.)

\topmargin = .5in	\leftmargin = .5in
\bottommargin = .5in	\rightmargin = .5in

This is the first line of text.  The top of it should be .5in from the
top of the paper.
\vfill
This is in the middle.  The left and right margins should be .5in each,
just as you might expect by now, if you've been reading.
\vfill
The last line's baseline should be .5in from the bottom. 
(This page tested assignments that decreased the margins.)

\advancetopmargin by 1in	\advanceleftmargin by 1in
\advancebottommargin by 1in	\advancerightmargin by 1in

This is the first line of text.  The top of it should be 1.5in from the
top of the paper.
\vskip0pt plus1filll
I bet you can guess what the left and right margins should be: yup,
1.5in.  Let's make this line a little longer, so it will actually hit
the margin.
\vskip0pt plus1filll
The last line's baseline should be 1.5in from the bottom.
