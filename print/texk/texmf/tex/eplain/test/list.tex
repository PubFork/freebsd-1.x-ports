       This item has two paragraphs since we want to see if it

          This item has two paragraphs, also, since we want to see if it
          works anywhere, and of course we want the paragraphs to be long.

             In fact, maybe we better make it three paragraphs. What
             will happen then? This should tell us.

This is a paragraph between the lists. It should be indented. But we'll
make it go on for more than one line, so we'll be able to see where the
left margin is.

\numberedlist
   \li hello there
       
       This item has two paragraphs. Isn't that annoying?
       In fact, the second paragraph has more than one line, at least
       I'm going to make it long enough so that that is true---I hope.
       
   \li second item

\listleftindent = 4pc
\unorderedlist
\li A shorter list, but with a bigger indent.
\numberedlist \li A nested list.
\endnumberedlist
\li The second item.
\endunorderedlist

A list with an xref label:
\numberedlist
\li[listitem] This is the first.
\endnumberedlist

And now we can refer to that item: \xrefn{listitem}.
