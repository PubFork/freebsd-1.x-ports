%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The), followed by the last two digits of
%%%                        the publication year.  If there is a volume
%%%                        entry, it is appended to the tag, prefixed
%%%                        by a hyphen.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        This scheme is systematic enough that it
%%%                        can be programmed: most of the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley book entries were created
%%%                        with an awk program from a dump of the AW
%%%                        database supplied by Mona Zeftel.  Older
%%%                        entries in this bibliography were modified
%%%                        on 28-Nov-1990 to conform to this tagging
%%%                        scheme.
%%%
%%%                        The choice of a limit of 3 letters was
%%%                        determined from experiments on the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley collection.  Long tags are
%%%                        undesirable because they are a nuisance to
%%%                        type, and also interfere with the tagged
%%%                        bibliography output produced using the
%%%                        LaTeX showtags style option.
%%%
%%%                        Journal article tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-volume-number-page, where the
%%%                        author part is the last name of the first
%%%                        author: for example,
%%%                        Gilchrist:NAMS-36-9-1199.
%%%
%%%                        Technical report tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-number: for example,
%%%                        Billawala:STAN-CS-89-1256.
%%%
%%%                        The Como InProceedings entries look like
%%%                        author:TEX85-page: for example,
%%%                        Agostini:TEX85-117.  Other InProceedings
%%%                        entries should follow a similar style.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility.",
