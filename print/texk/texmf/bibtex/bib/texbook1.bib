%%%
%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The), followed by the last two digits of
%%%                        the publication year.  If there is a volume
%%%                        entry, it is appended to the tag, prefixed
%%%                        by a hyphen.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        This scheme is systematic enough that it
%%%                        can be programmed: most of the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley book entries were created
%%%                        with an awk program from a dump of the AW
%%%                        database supplied by Mona Zeftel.  Older
%%%                        entries in this bibliography were modified
%%%                        on 28-Nov-1990 to conform to this tagging
%%%                        scheme.
%%%
%%%                        The choice of a limit of 3 letters was
%%%                        determined from experiments on the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley collection.  Long tags are
%%%                        undesirable because they are a nuisance to
%%%                        type, and also interfere with the tagged
%%%                        bibliography output produced using the
%%%                        LaTeX showtags style option.
%%%
%%%                        Journal article tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-volume-number-page, where the
%%%                        author part is the last name of the first
%%%                        author: for example,
%%%                        Gilchrist:NAMS-36-9-1199.
%%%
%%%                        Technical report tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-number: for example,
%%%                        Billawala:STAN-CS-89-1256.
%%%
%%%                        The Como InProceedings entries look like
%%%                        author:TEX85-page: for example,
%%%                        Agostini:TEX85-117.  Other InProceedings
%%%                        entries should follow a similar style.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility."

                 The publisher received camera-ready pages that were
                 prepared by the author with a 300-dpi laser printer.
                 The page style dimensions were suitably enlarged
                 while the photo plates were reduced so as to minimize
                 the granulosity of the signs. In practice the book
                 was prepared with 12pt option and reduced by the
                 photografic ratio of 0.8 so that the final real font
                 size is 9.6pt.

                 The whole book was prepared with the standard
                 Computer Roman fonts on purpose in order to show the
                 potential user what he can get witha standard
                 \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} kit. The simple pictures were prepared with
                 the ``picture'' environment.  The cover and the title
                 page were designed by a graphic expert of the
                 publishing company.",

                  assistance from the production department of
                  Academic Press, Boston.  The covers were done by the
                  publisher. It was typeset by the author using Plain
                  {\TeX} plus specially written macros. The code for
                  all macros used for the book are reproduced in it so
                  that the book itself contains all the
                  information---page layout specifications, fonts
                  used, and so on---about its own typesetting.

                  Over half the book consists of {\TeX} input and
                  output shown side-by-side, providing an explicit
                  example of how a part of the book was typeset.

                  The Academic Press logo on page iii, the
                  cataloging-in-publication data on page iv, and the
                  diagrams on page 33 were pasted in place by the
                  production department of Academic Press.

                  The diagrams were drawn using {\LaTeX}. Sample
                  printouts of pages were made on various laser
                  printers.  When everything seemed satisfactory, the
                  dvi files were copied onto IBM diskettes and were
                  mailed to Academic Press, and from them to the
                  American Mathematical Society.  The final copy was
                  produced by the A.M.S. using an APS micro-5
                  phototypesetter.  All fonts used in the book are
                  from the Computer Modern family.

                  Parts of the covers of the book, inside and outside,
                  were done in {\TeX} by the author (the code for this
                  is not included in the book).  The outside cover was
                  designed by Camille Pecoul of Academic Press and
                  produced at Allison Associates in Boston. The font
                  used for the title (on the covers) is Meridien. The
                  background pattern was obtained by shooting a
                  handmade marble paper as a black-and-white halftone
                  and then overprinting with the Pantone Matching
                  System (PMS).  The placement of material on the
                  cover was done by hand by Ms. Pecoul using a
                  mechanical board. The drop shadow effect was done at
                  Allison Associates.",

                 Press `Manual of Style' has been the standard
                 reference tool for authors, editors, copywriters, and
                 proofreaders. Updated many times since 1906, it now
                 goes into its thirteenth edition---the first to
                 introduce a change in title. Bowing to what has become
                 nearly universal usage, we now call the `Manual' what
                 everybody else calls it, `The Chicago Manual of
                 Style'---or, for short, `The Chicago Manual'.\par Two
                 pervasive features characterize the present edition:
                 it reflects the impact of the new technology on the
                 entire editing and publishing process, and it spells
                 out, in greater detail and with many more examples,
                 the procedures with which it deals. It is, in short,
                 much more a ``how-to'' book for authors and editors
                 than was its predecessor. In chapter 2, on manuscript
                 preparation and copyediting, for example, new sections
                 have been added on how to mark a manuscript and how to
                 mark type specifications on a script. Chapter 12
                 (``Tables''), completely rewritten, begins with advice
                 on how to make a table from raw data. Chapters 15
                 through 17, on documentation, have been reorganized
                 and greatly expanded, offering many more alternative
                 methods of citation and a wealth of examples. In
                 chapter 18 (``Indexes''), clear step-by-step
                 procedures for the mechanics of index making are set
                 forth. The terminology and methodology of
                 technological advances (in word processing,
                 computerized electronic typesetting, and the like) are
                 reflected most prominently in chapter 20,
                 ``Composition, Printing, and Binding'' (new to this
                 edition), and in the Glossary. Other notable features
                 of the present edition are chapter 4 (``Rights and
                 Permissions''), rewritten in light of the new
                 copyright law, and chapter 9 (``Foreign Languages''),
                 which includes a new table of dicritics, a pinyin
                 (Chinese) conversion chart and data on several more
                 languages.\par Throughout, `The Chicago Manual' aims
                 to give clear and straightforward guidelines for
                 preparing and editing copy---with the emphasis on the
                 sensible, the practical, and the economical. As did
                 its predecessors, the thirteenth edition of the
                 `Manual' states the style preferences of the
                 University of Chicago Press and reflects the current
                 practices and requirements of the great majority of
                 American publishers.",

                 the more lasting skills needed to use these tools
                 effectively. This book has been written in response to
                 this need. It provides, in one place, a coherent and
                 accessible introduction to the principles, processes,
                 and techniques of publishing that must be understood
                 before your document production with computers and
                 laser printers can realize its full potential. \par
                 Desktop Publishing Skills introduces publishing
                 basics, such as typesetting, design, and page make-up.
                 It is independent of any specific computer or laser
                 printer, making it a more generic and permanent
                 resource for study or reference. What's more, since
                 the entire book was produced by the authors using the
                 technologies and methods described in the book, you
                 will be able to pick up additional ideas on the
                 effective use of desktop publishing by just looking at
                 the book itself.",

                 on typesetting quality. Typesetting fundamentals are
                 explained and it is discussed why they are necessary.
                 This is done from the point of view of the
                 professional looking at the desktop publishing

                 underlying algorithmic concepts (e.g., paragraph
                 builder) that are superior to the concepts they

                 or trying to get your first article published in a
                 technical journal?  Handbook of Writing for the
                 Mathematical Sciences is the book for you!

                 This handy volume provides information on virtually
                 every issue you will face when writing a technical
                 paper or talk, from choosing the right journal to
                 handling your references.  You'll also get an overview
                 of the entire publication process--invaluable for
                 anyone hoping to publish in a technical journal.

                 To write a truly impressive paper, you'll need to
                 understand the anatomy of a research paper and the
                 steps involved in revising a draft.  This book offers
                 discussions of these fundamental topics, along with
                 illustrative and provocative examples.  Also included
                 are chapters on standard English usage, using
                 computers for writing and research, and writing
                 technical material when English is a foreign language.

                 This handbook provides much-needed advice on handling
                 the basic ingredients of a research paper, like
                 definitions, theorems, examples, and equations.  In
                 addition, appendices provide essential reference
                 material, including summaries of \LaTeX{} symbols and
                 Emacs commands, addresses of mathematical societies,
                 and a list of papers that have won expository writing
                 prizes.

                 This book is ideal for graduate students and
                 teachers. Among its special features:

                 \begin{itemize}
                 \item Detail and extensive use of examples make it an
                       excellent teaching tool

                 \item Discusses \TeX{} and other software tools for
                       preparing publications

                 \item Thorough treatment, with examples, of how to
                       write slides (transparencies) for a mathematical
                       talk.

                 \item Comprehensive index and extensive bibliography
                       make it an excellent reference

                 \item Readable for everyone in the field--from
                       undergraduates to seasoned professionals
