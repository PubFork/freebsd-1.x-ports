                 Printer: Digicopy, Corp., 858 Phoenix Dr., Ann Arbor,
                 MI 48108.

                 Frequency: Twice yearly, issued on astronomical
                 solstices (late June and late December).  An effort
                 is made to have the transmission carry the time and
                 date stamp of the exact minute of the astronomical
                 solstice (sort like a first day cover marking for a
                 stamp collector).

                 The ISSN number was assigned by the Library of
                 Congress beginning with the winter issue, 1991.",
  note-2 =       "The rationale behind the ISBN assignment is as
                 follows.  _Solstice_ is also available in hard copy
                 (\$15.95) a year for those wishing it. The book
                 containing the full year's issues is given an ISBN.
                 The first number in the list is the number for the
                 1990 volume.  The third number is the number for the
                 1991 volume.  In addition, in the summer, single
                 issues are available.  The second ISBN is the number
                 for the single summer 1991 issue.

                 Copyright: copyright is taken out on the hard copy.
                 Electronic files can be compared to the hard copy in
                 a library should a reader question whether or not a
                 document has been altered.

                 mathematics have a history of mutual research
                 stimulation (Konigsberg bridge problem, four color
                 problem,...), material from one discipline can shed
                 light on the other.  Astronomical solstices are
                 extreme positions at which time northern and southern
                 hemispheres receive maximum and minimum daylight or
                 night.  Between the solstices there is varying
                 dominance of day and night; so too, there is varying
                 dominance of mathematical and geographical
                 interaction in articles in Solstice.  Of course, the
                 extreme of a purely geographical or a purely
                 mathematical article is also suitable for submission.

                 experience in publishing matters using TeX, it was
                 very helpful to me to be hired by the University of
                 Chicago Press to typeset, using TeX, a volume in
                 their ``Lecture Notes in Physics''--(Walter Welford's
                 _Useful Optics_--quite suitable, I think!).

                 encountered a difficulty with some sort of `bold'
                 notation invented by an author.  For that, a
                 combination of advice from a colleague in mathematics
                 and from the University of Michigan's Computing
                 Center, helped me to figure out a way to solve the

                 (Solstice hard copy for 1991) are TeX-ed.  I typeset
                 documents using Plain TeX; the hard copy is obtained
                 by uploading the ASCII file into the University of
                 Michigan's mainframe and printing it out on their
                 Xerox 9700 (series) machine.  They have a number of
                 them at various sites across campus.  The print
                 quality is only 200 dpi, so in that regard TeX-ed
                 documents don't look as good as they should--hence,
                 difficulty in convincing non-TeXers of its value.
                 Every effort is made to get hard copy right after a
                 periodic maintenance of the machines.  Then photos
                 are inserted (pasted electronically) onto this

                 Xerox would make it so that a TeX file on a floppy
                 could be directly fed into the DocuTech--by-passing
                 the intermediate (conventional mainframe -- the
                 DocuTech functions as a mainframe) step.",

                 there was no peer-reviewed online journal of
                 mathematics, informing them of _Solstice_'s
                 existence.  There appears to be a great deal of

                 Buffalo Museum of Science--this journal dates from
                 1987.  It is not a TeX-ed journal; it is
                 peer-reviewed.  No doubt, though, you are aware of
                 Michael Strangelove's directory of electronic
                 journals--think he lists a subset that are TeX-ed.

                 it is printed on 100% recycled paper with a large
                 percentage of fiber from post-consumer (20% to 40%,
