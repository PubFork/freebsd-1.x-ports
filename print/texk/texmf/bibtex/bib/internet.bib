  note =         "The author takes on the task of teaching the current
                 state of the new data communication technologies, and
                 does a generally excellent job of it.  Chapter 1
                 introduces the basic concepts of packet networking,
                 explaining that technology in detail and drawing
                 contrasts to the T-1 TDM technology explained in The
                 Guide to T-1 Networking by the same author.  ASCII
                 and X.25 are referred to in this chapter, with only
                 the briefest description, so the reader should have
                 some rudimentary knowledge of data communication.
                 However the basic differences between packet
                 switching and circuit switching, and between
                 connection-oriented and connectionless tranmission,
                 are clearly explained so the reader can skip over
                 confusing terminology without loss.

                 Chapter 2 does an excellent job of explaining the
                 basic concepts underlying the various types of
                 packet, frame and cell technologies, the relative
                 advantages and disadvantages of each, layered
                 protocols, the OSI reference model and says a few
                 words about the functions of SNA, the Internet
                 protocols, the IEEE LAN standards and Signaling
                 System 7.

                 Chapter 3 uses T-1 as an example to explain the
                 SONET/STS and SDH framing technology.  The reader
                 should approach this chapter with a good
                 understanding of T-1 synchronization.  HDLC is also
                 described briefly in this chapter.

                 Chapter 4 explains frame relay, including the Local
                 Mangement Interface, and again makes a comparison to
                 X.25 (which is never described in detail).  This is
                 followed by an detailed explanation of the basics of
                 FDDI (but SMT isn't covered).  The MAN standards
                 DQDB, IEEE 802.6 and SMDS, which are all closely
                 related, are explained as a unit.  ATM is described,
                 with its relationship (or lack thereof) to SONET.
                 The StrataCom proprietary FastPacket protocol is
                 mentioned briefly, followed by some general design
                 principles for light-weight protocols, with brief
                 descriptions of XTP and HSTP.

                 If you have the necessary background to read it, as
                 explained above, I can recommend this book as an
                 introduction to the new networking technologies that
                 it covers.

                 explains the overall Novell architecture, and
                 introduces the Network General Sniffer network
                 analysis tool.  Chapters 2 and 3 explain the
                 Ethernet, Token Ring and ARCNET physical media.
                 Chapter 4 discusses the IPX, SPX and network
                 maintenance protocols; the author unfortunately does
                 not explain why you DON'T want to use Novell's
                 default Ethernet encapsulation.  He also notes that
                 IPX checksumming is disabled on the example he shows,
                 but doesn't mention that this is usual Novell
                 practice, or explain the implications.  This chapter
                 was written before packets greater than 512 bytes and
                 block mode were implemented.

                 Chapter 5 describes the NetWare operating system; the
                 Bindery; communications utilities; file attributes,
                 access rights, locking and synchronization; print
                 services; job servers; and accounting.  Chapter 6
                 describes the Message Handling Service (MHS) and some
                 gateways between it and other type of messaging
                 system.  Chapter 7 briefly describes data
                 organization, Btrieve, XQL and NetWare SQL.  Chapter
                 8 describes the Netwise RPC product and its
                 relationship to some other forms of RPC from other
                 vendors.

                 Chapter 9 describes the AT\&T STREAMS protocol
                 mechanism and its Novell implementation.  Chapter 10
                 briefly describes the NetWare support for AppleTalk.
                 Chapter 11 describes NetWare for VMS, Portable
                 NetWare (which supersedes NetWare for VMS), and how
                 Novell and DECnet networks can be gatewayed to each
                 other.

                 Chapter 12 briefly describes Novell support for WANS.
                 Chapter 13 discusses gateways between Novell and
                 TCP/IP, SNA (described as ``not quite as
                 nonproprietary as TCP/IP'' in what is surely the
                 understatement of the year!)  NetBIOS and OSI.

                 Much of the discussion is fairly superficial.  There
                 is, however, a good bibliography which provides
                 references to more detailed documents.  The glossary
                 and index look serviceable.  All chapters are
                 illustrated with reproductions of Sniffer displays.

                  Part I defines the Internet and discusses types of
                  of access to the network and steps to initiate
                  access to the network. It gives information on
                  providers/vendors the services for research,
                  education, commerce, and individual use.
                  Approximate costs are discussed in terms of such
                  factors as services desired, hardware used,
                  dedicated lines vs dialup, distance from host,
                  frequency of use, peak vs non-peak charges, and
                  telephone charges. Acceptable use is discussed,
                  explained, and illustrated. The seven chapters in
                  Part I are:
                  \begin{itemize}
                  \item
                    Introduction to the Internet (what it is, who is
                    in charge, what is and is not a part of it, kinds
                    of networks)
                  \item
                    How to Join the Internet (MX, dialup, individual
                    access, connecting networks)
                  \item
                    Costs (determining factors, network and individual
                    examples)
                  \item
                    Service Providers (vendors of network connections,
                    dialup vendors, providers of services within
                    states)
                  \item
                    Military Access (by each branch of the military)
                  \item
                    NSFNET Acceptable Use Policy
                  \item
                    Non-U.S. Sites (European cooperation and contacts,
                    Baltic and Nordic countries, Caribbean Basin, the
                    Pacific Rim, 30 specific countries, U.S. providers
                    of international connections)

                    Part II explains the concepts of the Internet,
                    such as the hierarchial Domain Name System (DNS)
                    and addressing, protocols (the TCP/IP suite, the
                    telnet protocol, file transfer protocal (FTP),
                    requests for comments (RFCs), for your information
                    (FYI), and standards (STDs). The six chapters in
                    Part II are:
                  \item
                    The Internet--More Information (historical,
                    physical, and growth)

                    Basic Internet Concepts (RFCs, FYIs, and STDs;
                    security, protocols, addressing, the Domain Name
                    System, directory services)
                  \item

                    news groups, file transfer protocol, telnet, and
                    information servers such as archie, Prospero, WWW,
                    WAIS, and the Internet gopher)
                  \item
                    Internet Organizations (network associations,
                    network administrative organizations,
                    administrative bodies, standards organizations,
                    security response centers, network information
                    centers, and user groups)
                  \item
