I'm not bothering to include the actual license in this distribution.
Write me if you want a copy and don't have one or six hundred of your own.

I used the `afm2tfm' program which comes with Tom Rokicki's dvips to
convert the AFM files to TFM and VF files.  You can get dvips from
labrea.stanford.edu.

To install these, just copy the relevant files somewhere TeX will find
them.  I use /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/urw.  Then append psfonts.add to
your current psfonts.map file that dvips uses.  If you use some other
dvi->ps translator, you're on your own.
