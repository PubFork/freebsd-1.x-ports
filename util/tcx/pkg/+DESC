	TCX - Transparently Compressed Executables (For Unix)

				by

	   Stewart Forster, University Of Melbourne, 1993

TCX is a system designed for the transparent decompression, execution
and recompression of executables under Unix.  It allows configuration
options such as the type of compression system used (compress(1),
gzip(1), your own local system etc), timeouts between recompressions,
and emergency directories in case a decompression fails from shortage
of disk space.  The system is designed with a reasonable amount of
robustness in mind, such as in the event of system crashes, or races
on trying to uncompress, compress or execute something.

	Currently TCX is only proven to run on Irix 4.*, Ultrix 4.2
or higher, and SunOs 4.1.1 or higher.  It may run on other releases
of these OS's but has not been tested.  It should also be relatively
easy to port to other OS's as much of the code is fairly straight
forward.

	The system is used here at the Department of Computer Science
University Of Melbourne, and in other departments on campus.  This is
the first official release of TCX to the world, so please feel free
to comment or help in bug fixes and machine reports by sending email
to slf@cs.mu.OZ.AU
