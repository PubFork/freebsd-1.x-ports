This set of tools is designed to make it easier to ship sources around.  I
wrote them because I do a lot of that as moderator of comp.sources.unix,
and nothing else did the job for me.  This set isn't perfect, but's very
close.  Included are a program to find source files, a program to
partition them into reasonable sizes, a program to make shell archives out
of them, a program to strip mail, news, and notes headers from archives
before feeding them to a shell, and a program that simulates enough
/bin/sh syntax so that non-Unix systems can unpack them.
