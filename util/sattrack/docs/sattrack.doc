GENERAL OVERVIEW

    SatTrack is a satellite tracking program that has been written in 'C' 
    code on a Sun/UNIX workstation in order to provide an alternative to PC 
    oriented programs like InstantTrack or QuikTrak. SatTrack is based on 
    program 'Orbit' by Robert W. Berger, N3EMO, but has been completely 
    re-written and enhanced with many new features. It provides a live display 
    which Orbit does not have, and other orbit prediction facilities, but no 
    graphics either. Cursor controls used in the live display are compatible 
    with the VT100 standard. The program reads the NORAD two-line element sets 
    directly. Other input files are defaults.dat, sites.dat, cities.dat and 
    modes.dat. These contain information on default parameters and various 
    sites and satellite modes like beacon frequencies, launch dates, attitudes, 
    transmission modes and so on. The file cities.dat contains the data base 
    for the nearest city display. SatTrack can track a single satellite for a 
    single ground station. There is no software for co-visibility between 
    several satellites or between several ground stations installed in this 
    release. 


INSTALLATION

    To install SatTrack on a Sun/UNIX workstation, place the distribution file 
    'sattrack.tar.Z' into your home directory. Uncompress the file by typing 
    'uncompress sattrack.tar'. Then unbundle the distribution file by typing 
    'tar xvpf sattrack.tar'. This will create the following directories in 
    your UNIX home directory:

        SatTrack/Data
        SatTrack/Doc
        SatTrack/Object
        SatTrack/Prediction
        SatTrack/Run
        SatTrack/Source

    All source code will be placed in SatTrack/Source and all auxiliary data 
    files (see below) in SatTrack/Data. Change directory to SatTrack/Source and 
    edit the file sattrack.h in order to change the variable STATIONCALL to 
    your call sign. To recompile sattrack type 'make clean' and 'make all'. 
    Edit your .login and/or .cshrc files to include ~/SatTrack/Run in your path.

    The Run directory will contain the executable files and the Object 
    directory the object code. The Data directory contains the files with the 
    NORAD two-line element sets as well as defaults.dat, modes.dat, cities.dat 
    and sites.dat. Predictions can be written into an output file which will 
    be placed in the Prediction directory. The Doc directory will contain all 
    documentation on SatTrack. 


INPUT DATA FILES

    Program SatTrack requires five input data files, all in ASCII format:

    tle.dat          contains NORAD or NASA two-line element sets
    defaults.dat     contains default start-up parameters
    sites.dat        contains the data base with ground station parameters
                     (name, latitude, longitude, altitude)
    cities.dat       contains data on nnn cities and other special locations; 
                     this part is not finished yet; one location (KSC)
                     is presently hardwired in satcity.c
    modes.dat        contains additional information on satellites (beacon 
                     frequencies, alias names, modes, launch dates etc.)

    The meaning of the numbers in each line are explained in the source 
    code listing (see 'readnorad.c'). Elements sets like the above can be 
    obtained from 'archive.afit.af.mil' (129.92.1.66) via anonymous FTP. 
    Change into the directory '/pub/space' and get 'tle.new'. Then place this 
    file as 'tle.dat' in the directory SatTrack/Data. This procedure can be 
    automated in the following way. Use the command 'crontab -e' to create a 
    crontab file with the following content:

        0 15 * * *    HOME/SatTrack/Run/getElementSets

    This will run 'getElementSets' every day at 15:00 h local time (in this 
    example). The executable shell script 'getElementSets' that calls up 
    'archive.afit.af.mil' (129.92.1.66) via anonymous FTP needs to be in the 
    directory SatTrack/Run and contains the following nine lines: 

        cd HOME/SatTrack/Data
        ftp -n 129.92.1.66 << !
        user anonymous LOGIN_NAME@HOST.LOCATION.NETWORK
        cd /pub/space
        get tle.new
        quit
        !
        cp tle.dat tle.bak
        cp tle.new tle.dat

    LOGIN_NAME@HOST.INSTITUTION.NETWORK, your e-mail address, is the password 
    used. The two-line element sets can also be obtained from the Celestial 
    Bulletin Board System in Fairborn, Ohio, via modem line (513) 427-0674. 
    Latest element sets for space shuttle missions can be obtained from 
    'spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov' (192.149.89.61) via TELNET or via telephone by 
    dialing (205) 895-0028. An element set for STS-47, for example, would be 
    placed in SatTrack/Data as 'sts-47.dat'.


    Example of defaults.dat:

        Site:             Berkeley CA
        Satellite:        Mir
        Element set:      tle
        Element set type: NORAD
        Time zone:        PST
        Duration:         3.0
        Min elevation:    10.0

    These parameters are the defaults that show up in <> brackets when 
    starting program 'sattrack'. Options for the time zone are UTC, MEZ, MSZ, 
    EST, EDT, CST, CDT, MST, MDT, PST,  PDT, and  HST. If other time zones 
    are needed these will have to be added in 'sattrack.c'. If a time zone 
    is entered that is not in this list the time zone is automatically set to 
    UTC. Program 'sattrack' does not check for daylight savings time when 
    reading the system time, since the UTC system time is used always. The 
    other time zones are used only for the live display and the prediction 
    tables.

    The length of the name of the ground station has to be 15 characters or 
    less. Otherwise it will be truncated to a length of 15 characters. The 
    first column of numbers is the geographical latitude [deg North], the 
    second the geographical longitude [deg West], and the third the altitude 
    [m]. Note that some other tracking programs count the longitude in eastern 
    direction. Here the convention of positive signs for western longitudes is 
    used. 


    Example of cities.dat:

    --- not yet required ---     (a city data base has not yet been located)


    Example of modes.dat:

        Satellite: OSCAR 10
        Alias: AO-10
        Beacon:          145.810000 MHz
        Mode: B           000 - 256

        Satellite: AO-13
        Beacon:          145.812000 MHz
        Attitude:        180.0  0.0 deg
        Mode: B           000 - 100
        Mode: JL          100 - 120
        Mode: LS          120 - 135
        Mode: JL          135 - 150
        Mode: B           150 - 256

        Satellite: PACSAT
        Alias: AO-16
        Beacon:          437.026250 MHz

        Satellite: INFORMTR-1
        Alias: AO-21
        Beacon:          145.822000 MHz

        Satellite: Mir
        Beacon:          145.550000 MHz
        Mode: FM            0 - 256

        Satellite: STS-47
        Alias: Endeavour
        Beacon:          145.550000 MHz
        Mode: FM            0 - 256
        Launch:  12-09-92  14:23:00 UTC
    
    If the satellite to be tracked is not listed in modes.dat or if no beacon 
    frequency is specified, the program will use a default value of 146.000 
    MHz. Note that if a satellite is listed in modes.dat its name in the line 
    'Satellite:' has to exactly match the name in the NORAD two-element data 
    file with lower and upper case letters. For example, AO-10 has to be 
    entered as OSCAR 10 and AO-21 as INFORMTR-1. An alias name can be 
    specified in the 'Alias:' line. It has to be one word without blanks, like 
    Fuji-2 or Columbia. This name will be used in addition to the NORAD 
    satellite name for the live display and the prediction tables. If a launch 
    date is specified in modes.dat the live display will show the mission 
    elapsed time (MET). 


PROGRAM START

    To start the program type 'sattrack [-t] [-v]'. The options are as follows:

    -t   allows specification of another time zone instead of the default time 
         zone listed in defaults.dat. This is useful to quickly run off a 
         prediction for a site elsewhere in the world without having to change 
         the default data file. 

    -v   enables the verbose mode. All default parameters, ground station data 
         and detailed orbital elements will be displayed at program start. 

    For all keyboard entries the default parameters are shown in <>. Hitting 
    the RETURN key each time will use these. Otherwise, both lower and upper 
    case letters will be accepted. In case of the site and the satellite name 
    a fraction of the name will be sufficient. The program will take the first 
    site or satellite name from the site list or the two-line element set that 
    matches the character string. One can choose between a live display and an 
    orbit prediction in a short and a long form. Examples of these are given 
    below. 


LIVE DISPLAY

    Once in the live display mode, the program cycles through a full 
    computation every 5 seconds and sleeps in between. In a strict sense, 
    the live display is not a real-time display since it runs under UNIX. 
    For most applications, however, this is not a disadvantage. It is very 
    important that the UNIX system clock is set correctly, though. The live 
    display is rather self-explanatory. An example of the screen layout is 
    shown below.
    
    In case of the space shuttle, the computation of the orbit number is 
    different from all other satellites. For the shuttle, the orbit 
    number increments each time the satellite crosses the ascending node. 
    The shuttle is launched into orbit #1. If the space shuttle is tracked, 
    the source of the element set, i.e. the element set type has to be 
    specified, since there is a difference in the convention for definition 
    of the reference orbit between NASA and NORAD. For satellites other than 
    the space shuttle the NORAD convention is used and the orbit number 
    increments when the satellite passes through the perigee. 

    The visibility display to the right of the percentage of the current orbit 
    indicates if the satellite is in the day ('D') or night ('N') part of its 
    orbit. If the satellite is above the horizon and in the day part of its 
    orbit and at the same time the Sun is below the nautical twilight limit 
    (-6 deg elevation), then the display shows 'V' (visible), since the 
    satellite will be visible to the naked eye, at least for the larger 
    satellites. However, the apparent brightness depends on the relative 
    angles between the Sun, the satellite and the ground station, and on the 
    shape, size and distance (range) of the satellite. 

    The eclipse and visibility conditions are also indicated by 'D', 'N' or 
    'V' in the lower right corner of the display for the circumstances of the 
    next pass, i.e. acquisition of signal (AOS), maximum elevation (MEL) and 
    loss of signal (LOS) of the satellite. 

    Azimuth and elevation angles of the Sun are shown for the location of the 
    ground station. 

    The Doppler shift is calculated for the beacon frequency displayed one 
    line above. The free-space path loss can be used for link quality 
    calculations. 

    The satellite mode depends on the phase of the satellite (the mean anomaly 
    in units of 0-256), as specified in modes.dat. If no satellite mode is 
    specified, the display shows blank. 

    In case of the space shuttle, distances are displayed in nautical miles 
    (NM) and otherwise they are in kilometers. Accordingly, velocities are 
    in NM/s or km/s.  

    The state vector of the satellite (position and velocity in cartesian 
    coordinates) is displayed below the bearing and ground track information. 

    The circumstances of the next pass are calculated and displayed in the 
    lower part of the screen. If the next pass has a maximum elevation of more 
    than 40 deg the maximum elevation and range at maximum elevation are shown 
    in reverse video. The countdown time represents the time until next AOS or 
    next LOS. One minute before AOS and during a satellite pass the countdown 
    time is displayed in reverse video. 

    The mission elapsed time (MET) will be displayed if the launch date and 
    time are specified in modes.dat. 

    The groundtrack location indicates the location of the sub-satellite 
    point with respect to the nearest location in the city data base. For now, 
    there is only one fixed location (Kennedy Space Center) hardwired in the 
    code, since an appropriate city data base could not be obtained so far.  

    An alarm (beep) is generated for each screen update less than one minute 
    away from either AOS or LOS. When the satellite being tracked is above the 
    horizon several numbers on the screen show up in reverse (the header line, 
    azimuth, elevation, range, Doppler shift and path loss). 

    Once the program is running in the live display mode, it can be frozen 
    and unfrozen with ^S and ^Q, and aborted with <CR>. Hitting the <SPACE> 
    bar will restart the program. 


ORBIT PREDICTION

    The orbit prediction mode allows the calculation of satellite passes for 
    a given ground station. The data will be either displayed on the video 
    terminal or written into a file in the Prediction directory which can 
    later be obtained as a hardcopy. The program generates tables in a short 
    and in a long form. The short form listing consists of one table per day 
    with one line per pass, indicating the time at AOS, MEL and LOS, the 
    duration of the pass, the azimuth at AOS, MEL and LOS, the maximum 
    elevation of the pass, the visibility code for AOS, MEL and LOS, and 
    number of the orbit in which the satellite is at AOS. Also, for the space 
    shuttle, if a launch date is specified in 'modes.dat' an additional column 
    shows the MET at AOS. Passes with a maximum elevation of more than 40 deg 
    are marked with an asterisk next to the MEL value. 

    The prediction in the long format consists of 12 columns. The first column 
    is the time in specified fixed increments from line to line. Most of the 
    table is self-explanatory. The column labeled 'Loss' is the free-space 
    path loss in dB. The column labeled 'Phs' is the orbital phase of the 
    satellite, i.e. the mean anomaly running from 0 through 256. The 'Md' 
    column is the satellite mode, derived from the phase and the entries in 
    modes.dat. This column will be blank if no modes are specified in 
    modes.dat. The last column is the visibility code of the satellite ('D', 
    'N' or 'V', see above). 

    An example for a prediction table in the short and long form is given 
    below. 


BUGS AND IMPERFECTIONS

    There is a number of inconveniences or imperfections that have not yet 
    been fixed. These will be taken care off in a later version. 

    1.   The 'nearest city' display is not yet implemented. It uses only one 
         location (KSC) at this time. 

    2.   The spacecraft's attitude can be specified in 'modes.dat', but is not 
         taken into account yet for the calculation of the squint angle.

    3.   The calculation of the height of the satellite does not take into 
         account the geoid model of the Earth. 

    4.   The azimuth and elevation angles of the Sun are precise within 
         0.15 deg only. 


AUXILIARY PROGRAMS

    The following three programs are not used with SatTrack but are rather 
    useful for other purposes.

    amsat:        generates a data file 'amsat.dat' in SatTrack/Data with 
                  orbital elements in the AMSAT format from a data file with 
                  orbital elements in the NORAD two-line format.

    checksum:     generates a two-line element file with the old checksum 
                  convention needed with InstantTrack V1.0. The input file 
                  is for example 'tle.dat' and the corresponding output file 
                  is 'tle.chk', also created in SatTrack/Data.

    readelements: reads two-line elements from a NORAD data file and displays 
                  them in plain language.

    selectsat:    generates a data file 'sel.dat' with a selected set of 
                  two-line orbital elements from 'tle.dat'. The names of the 
                  satellites selected are "hardwired" in the source code 
                  selectsat.c in SatTrack/Source.
