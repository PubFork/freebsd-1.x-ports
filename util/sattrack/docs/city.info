There is some kind of geographic server, but we don't
run it. Please contact Tom Libert, "libert@eecs.umich.edu"
for details; he is the person who set up this server.

Subject: City data base

Tom,

I'm looking for a data base that contains latitude, longitude and altitude 
of all major cities and maybe smaller islands in the world. I was told that 
the machine 'martini.eecs.umich.edu' contains that information, but apparently 
it's down (at least yesterday), since it doesn't even answer the 'ping'. I'll 
be using the data base for a satellite tracking program which is designed to 
show a live display on a VT100 style terminal and hence can't have graphics. 
To fill the numbers on the screen with more life I'd like to install a line 
showing where the current sub-satellite point is, much like:

         Ground Track Location:  234.0 km SW of San Francisco, CA

Thanks a lot for your help!

Manfred Bester

Tom Libert can be a tough person to get a hold of.  He really is
the only person who knows much about this, but I am willing to
make by best shot at answering any specific questions you might
have.  I wasn't involved in setting it up, but it does run on a
machine that I have administrative control over, and I'm willing
to do what I can to look into it to answer any specific questions.
