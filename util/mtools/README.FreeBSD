Mtools version 2.0.7, dated 6 Sep 92.
Ported by swallace@freefall.cdrom.com

Binaries go into /usr/local/bin.
Man pages go into /usr/local/man/man1.
To change the locations, edit BINDIR and MANDIR in Makefile.

To install, type "make all; make install; make clean".

Note that since the flock() call did not support devices, the -DFLOCK CFLAGS
was not included.  If someone can successfully provide mutual exclusion on
the devices, please let me know.
