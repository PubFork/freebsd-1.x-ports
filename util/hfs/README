-----------------
hfs is program which allows files to be copied off a Macintosh HFS
disk on a non-Macintosh computer.


2. What systems does "hfs" support?
-----------------------------------
hfs was developed under Linux (a Unix clone), but has been compiled and
run under MSDOS and Windows/NT.


3. Does hfs support writing files to an HFS disk?
-------------------------------------------------
Not yet, but the next version will.


4. Does hfs support 800k disks?
-------------------------------
No! And it never will (or can!)


5. Does hfs support HFS filesystems on other media?
---------------------------------------------------
Not yet, but it could if I had access to devices like these.


6. What do I need to compile hfs?
---------------------------------
A C++ compiler and a C compiler. I use gcc 2.5.2 on Unix and 
Microsoft Visual C++ for MSDOS and Windows/NT.

--------------------------------------------
The author is Craig Southeren, and I can be contacted
c/- geoffw@extro.ucc.su.oz.au


8. Where do I send flames?
--------------------------
/dev/null =8^)


9. What restrictions are placed on my use of using/modifiying/selling hfs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, here comes the legal stuff. hfs is generally covered by the GNU
General Public License version 2 (see the file COPYING for more info).
But I borrowed the filename globbing code from tcsh and that file requires
that I put the following notice somewhere:

 	This product includes software developed by the University of
 	California, Berkeley and its contributors.
