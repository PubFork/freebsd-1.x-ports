INTRODUCTION:

Here are some hints on where to find dictionaries and affix files for
various languages.  I have verified all of these as of 29-Nov-1993.

Some of the affix files distributed with ispell are identical to or
are based on the affix files at these ftp sites.

Older affix files from some of these sites will require changes to the
"defstringtype" and "altstringtype" statements to specify a
deformatter before they will work with ispell 3.1.  This is done by
adding a new quoted string, "TeX" or "nroff", after the first quoted
string in the statement.

Sites that use large numbers of affixes, or that use ISO Latin-1
character sets, will usually get better results by using Martin
Boyer's perl-based version of munchlist rather than the one
distributed with ispell.  This version is available for ftp from:

SITE:		ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca

FILES:		buildict.tar.gz
COMMENTS:	requires perl.  Note only one "d" in file name.

OTHER WORD LISTS:

The following lists may not be intended for use with ispell.  They may
be intended for other spell-checkers, or they may be targeted at
password-finding programs.  They will generally need an appropriate
affix file and will need to be processed with "munchlist" before they
will be useful with ispell.
