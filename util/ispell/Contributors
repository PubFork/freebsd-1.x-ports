Ispell has a long and convoluted history.  The following background
information on spelling checkers in general, and ispell in particular,
was provided to me by Les Earnest (les@dec-lite.stanford.edu):

> The earliest spelling checker (of sorts) of which I am aware was in a
> program that attempted to automatically receive human-keyed morse
> code, which can be ambiguous because of the variable timing between
> dots, dashes, intercharacter pauses, and interword pauses.  This
> program didn't use a full dictionary; instead, used a table of
> digraphs (two-letter sequences) that occur in English and barred
> improper letter sequences.  This program was written by someone at MIT
> Lincoln Lab around 1959 and, I think, ran on the TX-2 computer there.

[note: Ralph has since informed me that he wrote no such article.  The
program was called SPELL and was written in 1971.  Ralph provided me
with a reference to "Computer Programs for Spelling Correction", by
James L. Peterson, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1980, No. 96 in the series
"Lecture Notes in Computer Science."  This book states that Ralph's
SPELL program, which was the direct ancestor of ispell, was the first
computer program written for checking the spelling of text documents.
The book is also a good source of references on spelling programs.]

[Ralph mentions that SPELL was also ported to MIT's ITS and TOPS-10.]
   
The Tenex version of ispell was later revised by W. E. Matson (1974),
and W. B. Ackerman (1978).

In 1983, Pace Willisson (pace@prep.ai.mit.edu) converted this version to
the C language and modified it to work under Unix.

In 1987, Walt Buehring revised and enhanced ispell, and posted it to the
Usenet along with a dictionary.  In addition, Walt wrote the first version
of "ispell.el", the emacs interface.

Geoff Kuenning (geoff@ITcorp.com, that's me, and by the way I
pronounce it "Kenning"; the "u" is silent) picked up this version,
fixed some bugs, and added further enhancements.  In 1988 I got
ambitious and rewrote major portions of the code, resulting in the
table-driven multi-lingual version.  Ole Bjoern Hessen
(obh@ifi.uio.no) in Norway alpha-tested this version and provided
several important enhancements.

Bob Devine (vianet!devine) provided two larger dictionaries (which
became the basis for english.1 and english.2) to Geoff for inclusion
with this posting.

Ashwin Ram (ram@@cs.yale.edu) made substantial enhancements to Walt
Buehring's emacs interface, and provided them to Geoff for inclusion
with an earlier posting.

The emacs interface was then completely overhauled by Ken Stevens
(stevens@@hplabs.hp.com), who also beta-tested the software and
without whom this posting would not have been possible.  If there's a
feature in the emacs interface that you like, you probably have Ken to
thank for it.  His efforts have been tireless for many years.

Martin Boyer made major contributions to the munchlist script,
including producing a version that runs under perl (see
languages/Where for instructions on how to get that version).
Philippe-Andre Prindeville provided xspell (a Motif-based X
interface), and Moritz Willers provided a NeXTStep interface.

Many other enhancements and bug fixes were provided by the numerous
people listed below.  Do not assume, because I omit mention of their
specific contributions, that these persons were any less instrumental
in creating the version of ispell that you see before you.  Every one
of them made a significant contribution, and it is only a lack of
space that prevents me from detailing these contributions.  This
version of ispell is truly a cooperative effort, and it would not
exist without the help of the generous souls listed above and below.

A full list of contributors, including those mentioned above, follows.  (I
think I have listed everyone, but if you contributed and aren't listed,
let me know and I'll correct it):
