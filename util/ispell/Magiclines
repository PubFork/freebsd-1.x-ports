# Revision 1.2  1994/05/25 01:27:22  asami
# This is the FreeBSD port by Piero Serini (piero@strider.st.dsi.unimi.it).
# Fixes include specifying correct dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words),
# changing Makefiles, adding package target, etc.
#
# Note that this package requires an enormous amount of free disk space in
# /usr/tmp (30MB according to Piero).  There is no /usr/tmp on freefall so
# I couldn't compile it here but it worked at my home machine.
#
# Revision 1.1  1994/05/08  12:56:24  piero
# Initial revision
#
# Revision 1.7  1994/01/25  07:11:10  geoff
# Get rid of all old RCS log lines in preparation for the 3.1 release.
