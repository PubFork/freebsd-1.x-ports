#	Make an ispell patch kit.  This is not a clever script,
#	just a handy one.
#
#	Usage:
#
USAGE="Usage:  Makepatch [-n] [-d destdir] [new-files]"
#
#	destdir is the directory in which the kits and patches are kept.
#
#	new-files are any new files to be added to the distribution.
#
#	The -n switch suppresses RCS updates, so that the patch can be
#	tested.
