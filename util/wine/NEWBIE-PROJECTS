This document is meant to be a collection of ideas for projects that
newbie Wine developers can attempt.  These projects are meant to avoid
interference with veteran developers.

1. Develop a printer interface specifcation and develop printer
   drivers for various printers.

2. Bug fixing.  If something doesn't work on your system, find
   out why, and submit patches.  A good way to approach this is to
   try to run an application that you would like to see working.
   Find out why it doesn't, fix it, and submit patches.

3. Develop freeware versions of MS Windows standard programs.
   It would be nice to have completely free distributable versions
   of file manager, program manager, write, notepad, ...
   Also, we need free versions of the standard DLLs such as
   COMMDLG.
