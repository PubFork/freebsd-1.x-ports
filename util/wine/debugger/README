	This is the core of the Wine debugger.  Many pieces have been
shamelessly stolen - the reverse assember was stolen from gdb more or
less intact.  It turns out that there are two variables that are set
differently if you are reverse assembling 16 bit code, and on the
whole it seems to work.  There may be bugs for all I know.

	As far as non-linux systems are concerned, I simply ripped off
the linux configuration files from gdb.  Other systems may be close
enough for these to work properly, but some tweaking may be required.

	I apologize for the non-portability of this, but I wrote the
whole thing in about 4 hours, most of the time spent debugging a
stupid mistake in the parser.
