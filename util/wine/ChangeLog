	Code cleanup.

	needed since it has USER_InitApp.

	* [misc/resource.c]

	Sysres.dll). WineLib will be using much code of the loader again.
	So I removed some ifdefs that were used by WineLib.

	Added load_typeinfo and load_nameinfo (and the corresponding
	functions in [toolkit/sup.c]

	Added integer convertion functions in the needed places.

	Added very ugly patch (includes wine.c). In the next release I
	plan to move back all the loader routines to ~/loader. In the
	meantime I needed this patch. It doesn't affect any of the
	emulator code (its ifdefed for WineLib).

	* [misc/main.c]
	Cleaned up call to WinMain (now uses [toolkit/winmain.c]
	Ifdefed argument number checking when compiling the library.

	* [loader/wine.c]

	read.  When compiling the emulator it still uses the direct read
	for performance.

	* [include/class.h]
	Added WINE_PACKED macro instead of __attribute__ ((packed))
