ss

  This is ``ss'' release 1.2-beta.

  SS is a spreadsheet program.  It is based upon the well known(?)
  public domain spreadsheet program sc 6.19.

  ss is Curses based.  It should function on any ASCII terminal, or in
  any terminal window in a windowing environment.

  ss is a major overhaul of the _user_interface_ of sc.  I tried to
  make it much more similar to the spreadsheets found on personal
  computers.  It makes use of hierarchical menus, and has a full range
  of `standard' spreadsheet functions.

  I toyed around with starting off at version number 7.0, since I used
  sc 6.19 (and later 6.21) as my starting point, but I decided that
  would be a bit presumptuous.  So I hope this low release/version
  number doesn't scare away too many people.  There really is a *LOT*
  of work put in by a lot of people over a long period of time in the
  sc 6.19 code, which serves as the heart of ss.

  This is an ASCII spreadsheet program.  This is not Lotus 1-2-3.  It
  is not Microsoft Excel.  It does not do graphs or charts.  It does
  not do drawings.  It does not use a mouse.

  It _does_ do a fine job of manipulating rows and columns of numbers.
  Want a simple way of managing your student's grades, calculating class
  averages, etc?  No problem.  Want to figure out how much money you
  can borrow from the bank for a mortgage?  We can do that.

  NOTE: THIS IS A BETA RELEASE.  TREAD CAREFULLY.
