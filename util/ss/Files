**INCOMPLETE**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE FILES IN THE DISTRIBUTION:

  NOTE:  Files marked with a "*" are files that are either unchanged
         from their ``sc 6.21'' counterparts, or have only minor
	 modifications.  (OR, I've never even looked at them, and
	 have no comprehension at all as to how they work :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
* cmds.c	- Command routines
* crypt.c	- Encryption utilities.  Our system, being outside the US, 
		  can not use this.  Therefore this file is completely
		  untouched, and the encryption feature is completely
		  untried in 'ss'.

  ctrl.c / ctrl.h - Process Control Character Commands (as opposed to
		  menu commands).

  disprange.c / disprange.h 	- Range Display/Manipulate functions.
* format.c	- formating a number.

  getinput.c / getinput.h
		- Functions for getting a line of input.  Allows 
		  user editting of the input, etc.  Based upon
		  "input-edit" by Chris Thewalt.  

* gram.y	- YACC file -> command parser.  Becomes gram.c
* interp.c	- Expression interpreter.

  keys.h	- Header file, defining 'ss' key bindings.
* lex.c		- lexical analyzer (input processing also)

  menu.c / menu.h
	- Menu Driver.  Functions for displaying the command menus and
	  processing the related input.

  menu_cell.c / menu_cell.h	- Cell Menu Operations
  menu_edit.c / menu_edit.h	- Edit Menu Operations
  menu_file.c / menu_file.h	- File Menu Operations
  menu_macro.c / menu_macro.h	- Macro Menu Operations
  menu_misc.c / menu_misc.h	- Misc Menu Operations
  menu_name.c / menu_name.h	- Name Sub-Menu Operations
  menu_rowcol.c / menu_rowcol.h	- Row Menu & Column Menu Operations

* range.c	- Range Manipulations
* screen.c	- Curses based screen driver.  (screen update routines)
  ss.c / ss.h	- main program, main loop.
  version.c	- 'ss' release version number
* vmtbl.c	- Spreadsheet 'tbl' creation
* xmalloc.c	- a "safer saner" malloc, for careless programmers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MISC FILES:
  
  Bugs		- Known problems not yet fixed.
  Copyright	- Self-explanatory.
  Files		- This file
  Makefile	- for building 'ss'
  Prog.doc	- random thoughts, directed at programmers
  README	- READ THIS FILE FIRST.  General overview, & Instructions
  Todo		- Ideas for enhancements for the next version.

* eres.sed	-\ Sed command files.  Used in the Makefile, to build 
* sres.sed	-/ experres.h and statres.h

  ss.man	- main man page for ss.
* torev		- Sed command file.  Used by the Makefile, in building
		  'ss.l' from 'ss.man'.  (Some global changes are made,
                  see the warning comments in 'ss.man').

  sc_stuff/	- Contains misc. files left over from sc.  No longer used.
  sunfkeys/     - See 'README' and 'sunfkeys/README' for the best 
		  explanation of what this is.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSS FILES:

* pss.c		- Converts ASCII files into sc (and, therefore 'ss')
		  compatible files.  See the man page for more info.
* pss.doc	- Man page for psc.c

	NOTE: These files are identical to the "psc.c" and "psc.doc"
	      files from the sc 6.21 package, they have only been
	      renamed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VMS FILES: 

* VMS_NOTES	- Instructions for VMS users
* build.com	- Makefile equivalent, for VMS systems
