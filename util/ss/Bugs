BUGS:

-> I wrote this with System V curses, I haven't really tried it out
   in a pure BSD-ish environment.

-> Control-O's (^O) seem to get eaten by the system before
   the program can get hold of them.  Therefore the 
   ^O (toggle overwrite mode) command in getinput.c
   does not work.  What can be done about this?
