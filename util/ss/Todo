Art's TODO list

IDEAS/THOUGHTS FOR THE NEXT RELEASE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1) Change the <CR> feature.  Instead of toggling what to do, keep
   track of the last arrow key direction, and make *that* the 
   <CR> direction (like EZ-calc)

- Reverse video on some of the prompts?
- Convert smaller functions to macro's

- Clean up the code.  See if we can move some of those #IFDEF's
  into a header file and get them out of the code.  SEE the document
  on code style!

2) /RowColumn
    - Yank should (like Merge) automagically insert Rows or Columns 
    (either-or, not both) for the yanked text.

3) work up a cut & paste gizmo, instead of the current
   kludgey delete/yank/merge mess

4) Context (so-so) sensitive on-line help!

5) Tutorial Spreadsheet

6) startup "rc" file for setting lots of things up
	-> ability to bind keys & Fkeys to actions 
	   (this'll probably require a lot of work in the
	   interpretation of command keys in the code, but
	   it'd really make the program MUCH better)

7) Trim the man page to a bare-bones quick-reference -> I think that's
   the best use for it -> then put together a LaTeX(?) tutorial/introduction
   manual full of verbiage & other stuff that most folks only need to see
   occaisionally.   

   (??? Is this a good idea ???)

8) Put an indicator in the top left corner of the spreadsheet
   display, an ``*'' to indicate when the spreadsheet has been changed.
   (This would go in the blank space left of the "   A   " and above
    the "0  ")

   flip the row/colum labels where the cursor is located into
   inverse video ???????  make it easier to locate the cursor?
 
9) clean up sc.h -> distribute files amongst proper *.c files ??
		 -> or leave all in one *.c file, but organize the file

10) Row/Column Menu -> "Show".  In 'sc' you could enter a range of 
    	rows or columns to show.  Add this functionality back?
