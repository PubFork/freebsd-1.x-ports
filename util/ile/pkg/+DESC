ile - the Interactive Line Editor

ILE allows you to run other programs interactively with the full benefit of
readline-style line editing and without having to change those programs at all.

Say you're in for a lengthy ftp session with your favorite ftp site.  You
could simply say:

	ile ftp gatekeeper.dec.com

And get full line-editing (and history) within your ftp session.  Try it!
You'll like it! :-)	- Jordan [jkh]
