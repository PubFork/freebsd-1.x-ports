.Sh NAME
.Nm md5
.Nd produce cryptographic checksum
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm md5
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl x
.Op Fl s Ar string
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm md5
will produce the ``MD5'' cryptographic checksum over a range of bytes.
The checksum which is output in hexadecimal.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl t
Run timing test.
.It Fl x
Run standard tests.
.It Fl s Ar string
Compute cryptographic checksum of
.Ar string .
.El
.Pp
Without any flags the default action is to 
compute the ``MD5'' cryptographic checksum of the named files.
If no filename is specified, or if the special filename ``-'' is
mentioned, stdin is read.
If the special file ``--'' is seen, all further arguments will be
treated as filenames, even if they match any of the above options.
.Sh SECURITY
This is a direct quote from RFC-1321:

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is simple to implement, and provides
a "fingerprint" or message digest of a message of arbitrary length.
It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations. The MD5 algorithm
has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses. It is, however, a
relatively new algorithm and further security analysis is of course
justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this sort.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm md5
program is identical with the example code in appendix A of RFC-1321,
except for some changes in argument processing and error handling.

.Sh AUTHOR
The program it self must be attributed to the author of the RFC-1321
document: Ronald L. Rivest <rivest@theory.lcs.mit.edu>
