     This is a direct quote from RFC-1321:

     The MD5 message-digest algorithm is simple to implement, and provides a
     "fingerprint" or message digest of a message of arbitrary length.  It is
     conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages having the
     same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations, and that the dif-
     ficulty of coming up with any message having a given message digest is on
     the order of 2^128 operations. The MD5 algorithm has been carefully scru-
     tinized for weaknesses. It is, however, a relatively new algorithm and
     further security analysis is of course justified, as is the case with any
     new proposal of this sort.

     The md5 program is identical with the example code in appendix A of
     RFC-1321, except for some changes in argument processing and error han-
     dling.
