This directory contains the source for Octave, a high-level interactive
language for solving numerical problems.  See the files README.octave
and Announce for more general information, and the file NEWS for a
list of recent changes.

Binary distributions:
--------------------

As of version 0.72, binaries for several popular systems are
distributed along with the source, and are available in the following
subdirectories:

  subdirectory            binary compiled on
  -----------------------------------------------------
  i486-sysv4              Intel 486 running Unix System V Release 4
  i486-linux              Intel 486 running Linux
  m68k-next-bsd           NeXT
  mips-dec-ultrix42       DECstation running Ultrix 4.2
  rs6000-ibm-aix3.2       RS/6000 running AIX 3.2
  sparc-sun-sunos4.1.2    Sun SPARC running SunOS 4.1.2

Note:

  * Gnuplot binaries are *not* included.  For the plotting commands to
    work, you will need to install gnuplot on your system.  See the
    file INSTALL.octave in the top level directory of the distribution
    for more details.

  * Octave has been compiled assuming that you have `less' installed.
    You can use the environment variable PAGER to choose another pager.
 

A note about .gz files:
----------------------

Files with names ending in `.gz' have been compressed with `gzip', and
files with names ending in `.Z' have been compressed with the standard
Unix compress utility.

Unlike the compress utility, gzip is free of any known software
patents and tends to compress better anyway.  Gzip can uncompress
`compress'-compressed files too, so you can install it as "uncompress"
and use it to handle both types of files.

The gzip program is available in the directory /pub/gnu in shar, tar,
or gzipped tar format (for those who already have a prior version of
gzip and want faster data transmission).  It works on virtually every
unix system, MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS.
