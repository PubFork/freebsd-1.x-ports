Summary of changes for version 0.79:
-----------------------------------

  * New control systems functions:

     dgram -- Returns the discrete controllability and observability gramian.
     dlqr  -- Discrete linear quadratic regulator design.
     dlqe  -- Discrete linear quadratic estimator (Kalman Filter) design.
     c2d   -- Convert continuous system description to discrete time
              description assuming zero-order hold and given sample time.

  * The max (min) functions can now return the index of the max (min)
    value as a second return value.

Summary of changes for version 0.78:
-----------------------------------

  * Octave's handling of global variables has been completely
    rewritten.  To access global variables inside a function, you must
    now declare them to be global within the function body.  Likewise,
    if you do not declare a variable as global at the command line,
    you will not have access to it within a function, even if it is
    declared global there.  For example, given the function

      function f ()
        global x = 1;
        y = 2;
      endfunction

    the global variable `x' is not visible at the top level until the
    command

      octave:13> global x

    has been evaluated, and the variable `y' remains local to the
    function f() even if it is declared global at the top level.

    Clearing a global variable at the top level will remove its global
    scope and leave it undefined.  For example,

      octave:1> function f ()   # Define a function that accesses
      >  global x;              #   the global variable `x'.
      >  x
      > endfunction
      octave:2> global x = 1    # Give the variable `x' a value.
      octave:3> f ()            # Evaluating the function accesses the
      x = 1                     #   global `x'.
      octave:4> clear x         # Remove `x' from global scope, clear value.
      octave:5> x = 2           # Define new local `x' at the top level
      x = 2
      octave:6> f               # The global `x' is no longer defined.
      error: `x' undefined near line 1 column 25
      error: evaluating expression near line 1, column 25
      error: called from `f'
      octave:7> x               # But the local one is.
      x = 2

  * The new function, `is_global (string)' returns 1 if the variable
    named by string is globally visible.  Otherwise, returns 0.

  * The implementation of `who' has changed.  It now accepts the
    following options:

      -b -builtins   -- display info for builtin variables and functions
      -f -functions  -- display info for currently compiled functions
      -v -variables  -- display info for user variables
      -l -long       -- display long info

    The long output looks like this:

      octave:5> who -l

      *** currently compiled functions:

      prot  type               rows   cols  name
      ====  ====               ====   ====  ====
       wd   user function         -      -  f

      *** local user variables:

      prot  type               rows   cols  name
      ====  ====               ====   ====  ====
       wd   real scalar           1      1  y

      *** globally visible user variables:

      prot  type               rows   cols  name
      ====  ====               ====   ====  ====
       wd   complex matrix       13     13  x

    where the first character of the `protection' field is `w' if the
    symbol can be redefined, and `-' if it has read-only access.  The
    second character may be `d' if the symbol can be deleted, or `-'
    if the symbol cannot be cleared.

  * The new built-in variable ignore_function_time_stamp can be used
    to prevent Octave from calling stat() each time it looks up
    functions defined in M-files.  If set to "system", Octave will not
    automatically recompile M-files in subdirectories of
    $OCTAVE_HOME/lib/VERSION if they have changed since they were last
    compiled, but will recompile other M-files in the LOADPATH if they
    change.  If set to "all", Octave will not recompile any M-files
    unless their definitions are removed with clear.  For any other
    value of ignore_function_time_stamp, Octave will always check to
    see if functions defined in M-files need to recompiled.  The
    default value of ignore_function_time_stamp is "system".

  * The new built-in variable EDITOR can be used to specify the editor
    for the edit_history command.  It is set to the value of the
    environment variable EDITOR, or `vi' if EDITOR is not set, or is
    empty.

  * There is a new built-in variable, INFO_FILE, which is used as the
    location of the info file.  Its initial value is
    $OCTAVE_HOME/info/octave.info, so `help -i' should now work
    provided that OCTAVE_HOME is set correctly, even if Octave is
    installed in a directory different from that specified at compile
    time.

  * There is a new command line option, --info-file FILE, that may be
    used to set Octave's idea of the location of the info file.  It
    will override any value of OCTAVE_INFO_FILE found in the
    environment, but not any INFO_FILE="filename" commands found in
    the system or user startup files. 

  * Octave's Info reader will now recognize gzipped files that have
    names ending in `.gz'.

  * The save command now accepts regular expressions as arguments.
    Note that these patterns are regular expressions, and do not work
    like filename globbing.  For example, given the variables `a',
    `aa', and `a1', the command `save a*' saves `a' and `aa' but not
    `a1'.  To match all variables beginning with `a', you must use an
    expression like `a.*' (match all sequences beginning with `a'
    followed by zero or more characters).

  * Line and column information is included in more error messages.

Summary of changes for version 0.77:
-----------------------------------

  * Improved help.  The command `help -i topic' now uses the GNU Info
    browser to display help for the given topic directly from the
    Texinfo documenation.

  * New function: chol -- Cholesky factorization.

Summary of changes for version 0.76:
-----------------------------------

  * Better run-time error messages.  Many now include line and column
    information indicating where the error occurred.  Octave will also
    print a traceback for errors occurring inside functions. If you
    find error messages that could use improvement, or errors that
    Octave fails to catch, please send a bug report to
    bug-octave@che.utexas.edu.

  * If gplot (or gsplot) is given a string to plot, and the string
    does not name a file, Octave will pass the string along to gnuplot
    directly.  This allows commands like

      gplot "sin (x)" w l, data w p

    to work (assuming that data is a variable containing a matrix of
    values).

  * Long options (--help, --version, etc.) are supported.

Summary of changes for version 0.75:
-----------------------------------

  * The documentation is much more complete, but still could use a lot
    of work.

  * The history function now prints line numbers by default.  The
    command `history -q' will  omit them.

  * The clear function now accepts regular expressions.

  * If gplot (or gsplot) is given a string to plot, and the string
    names a file, Octave attempts to plot the contents of the file.

  * New functions:

    history:

      run_history  -- run commands from the history list.
      edit_history -- edit commands from the history list with your
                      favorite editor.

    linear algebra:

      balance         -- Balancing for algebraic and generalized
			 eigenvalue problems.
      givens          -- Givens rotation.
      is_square       -- Check to see if a matrix is square.
      qzhess          -- QZ decomposition of the matrix pencil (a - lambda b).
      qzval           -- Generalized eigenvalues for real matrices.
      syl             -- Sylvester equation solver.

    control systems:

      is_symmetric    -- Check to see if a matrix is symmetric.
      abcddim         -- Check dimensions of linear dynamic system [A,B,C,D].
      is_controllable -- Check to see if [A,B,C,D] is controllable.
      is_observable   -- Check to see if [A,B,C,D] is observable.
      are             -- Solve algebraic Ricatti equation.
      dare            -- Solve discrete-time algebraic Ricatti equation.
      lqe             -- Kalman filter design for continuous linear system.
      lqr             -- Linear Quadratic Regulator design.
      lyap            -- Solve Lyapunov equation.
      dlyap           -- Solve discrete Lyapunov equation.
      tzero           -- Compute the transmission zeros of [A,B,C,D].

Summary of changes for version 0.74:
-----------------------------------

  * Formal parameters to functions are now always considered to be
    local variables, so things like

      global x = 0
      global y = 0
      function y = f (x) x = 1; y = x; end
      f (x)

    result in the function returning 1, with the global values of x
    and y unchanged.

  * Multiple assignment expressions are now allowed to take indices,
    so things like

      octave:13> [a([1,2],[3,4]), b([5,6],[7,8])] = lu ([1,2;3,4])

    will work correctly.

Summary of changes for version 0.73:
-----------------------------------

  * Saving and loading global variables works correctly now.

  * The save command no longer saves builtin variables.

  * Global variables are more reliable.

  * Matrices may now have one or both dimensions zero, so that
    operations on empty matrices are now handled more consistently.

    By default, dimensions of the empty matrix are now printed along
    with the empty matrix symbol, `[]'.  For example:

      octave:13> zeros (3, 0)
      ans = 

      [](3x0)

    The new variable `print_empty_dimensions' controls this behavior.
    
    See also Carl de Boor, An Empty Exercise, SIGNUM, Volume 25,
    pages 2--6, 1990, or C. N. Nett and W. M. Haddad, A
    System-Theoretic Appropriate Realization of the Empty Matrix
    Concept, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Volume 38,
    Number 5, May 1993.

  * The right and left division operators `/' and `\' will now find a
    minimum norm solution if the system is not square, or if the
    coefficient matrix is singular.

  * New functions:

      hess   -- Hessenberg decomposition
      schur  -- Ordered Schur factorization
      perror -- print error messages corresponding to error codes
                returned from the functions fsolve, npsol, and qpsol
                (with others to possibly be added later).

  * Octave now prints a warning if it finds anything other than
    whitespace or comments after the final `end' or `endfunction'
    statement.

  * The bodies of functions, and the for, while, and if commands are
    now allowed to be empty.

  * Support for Gill and Murray's QPSOL has been added.  Like NPSOL,
    QPSOL is not freely redistributable either, so you must obtain
    your own copy to be able to use this feature.  More information
    about where to find QPSOL and NPSOL are in the file README.NLP.

Summary of changes for version 0.72:
-----------------------------------

  * For numeric output, columns are now lined up on the decimal point.
    (This requires libg++-2.3.1 or later to work correctly).

  * If octave is running interactively and the output intended for the
    screen is longer than one page and a pager is available, it is
    sent to the pager through a pipe.  You may specify the program to
    use as the pager by setting the variable PAGER.  PAGER may also
    specify a command pipeline.

  * Spaces are not always significant inside square brackets now, so
    commands like

      [ linspace (1, 2) ]

    will work.  However, some possible sources of confusion remain
    because Octave tries (possibly too hard) to determine exactly what
    operation is intended from the context surrounding an operator.
    For example:

    -- In the command 

	 [ 1 - 1 ]

       the `-' is treated as a binary operator and the result is the
       scalar 0, but in the command

	 [ 1 -1 ]

       the `-' is treated as a unary operator and the result is the
       vector [ 1 -1 ].

    -- In the command

	 a = 1; [ 1 a' ]

       the single quote character `'' is treated as a transpose operator
       and the result is the vector [ 1 1 ], but in the command

	 a = 1; [ 1 a ' ]

       an error message indicating an unterminated string constant is
       printed.

  * Assignments are just expressions now, so they are valid anywhere
    other expressions are.  This means that things like

      if (a = n < m) ... endif

    are valid.  This is parsed as:  compare `n < m', assign the result
    to the variable `a', and use it as the test expression in the if
    statement.

    To help avoid errors where `=' has been used but `==' was
    intended, Octave issues a warning suggesting parenthesis around
    assignments used as truth values.  You can suppress this warning
    by adding parenthesis, or by setting the value of the new builtin
    variable `warn_assign_as_truth_value' to 'false' (the default
    value is 'true').

    This is also true for multiple assignments, so expressions like

      [a, b, c] = [u, s, v] = expression

    are now possible.  If the expression is a function, nargout is set
    to the number of arguments for the right-most assignment.  The
    other assignments need not contain the same number of elements.
    Extra left hand side variables in an assignment become undefined.

  * The default line style for plots is now `lines' instead of
    `points'.  To change it, use the `set data style STYLE' command.

  * New file handling and I/O functions:

      fopen    -- open a file for reading or writing
      fclose   -- close a file
      fflush   -- flush output to a file
      fgets    -- read characters from a file
      frewind  -- set file position to the beginning of a file
      fseek    -- set file position
      ftell    -- tell file position
      freport  -- print a report for all open files
      fscanf   -- read from a file
      sscanf   -- read from a string
      scanf    -- read from the standard input

  * New builtin variables for file and I/O functions:

      stdin    -- file number corresponding to the standard input stream.
      stdout   -- file number corresponding to the standard output stream.
      stderr   -- file number corresponding to the standard error stream.

    The following may be used as the final (optional) argument for
    fseek: 

      SEEK_SET -- set position relative to the beginning of the file.
      SEEK_CUR -- set position relative to the current position.
      SEEK_END -- set position relative to the end of the file.

  * New function: setstr -- convert vectors or scalars to strings
    (doesn't work for matrices yet).

  * If possible, computer now prints the system type instead of
    always printing `Hi Dave, I'm a HAL-9000'.

  * Octave now properly saves and restores its internal state
    correctly in more places.  Interrupting Octave while it is
    executing a script file no longer causes it to exit.

  * Octave now does tilde expansion on each element of the LOADPATH.

  * A number of memory leaks have been plugged.

  * Dependencies for C++ source files are now generated automatically
    by g++.

  * There is a new command line option, -p PATH, that may be used to
    set Octave's loadpath from the command line.  It will override any
    value of OCTAVE_PATH found in the environment, but not any
    LOADPATH="path" commands found in the system or user startup files.

  * It is now possible to override Octave's default idea of the
    location of the system-wide startup file (usually stored in
    $(prefix)/lib/octave/octaverc) using the environment variable
    OCTAVE_HOME.  If OCTAVE_HOME has a value, Octave will look for
    octaverc and its M-files in the directory $OCTAVE_HOME/lib/octave.

    This allows people who are using binary distributions (as is
    common with systems like Linux) to install the real octave binary
    in any directory (using a name like octave.bin) and then install
    a simple script like this

      #!/bin/sh
      OCTAVE_HOME=/foo/bar/baz
      export OCTAVE_HOME
      exec octave.bin

    to be invoked as octave.


Summary of changes for version 0.71:
-----------------------------------

  * Much improved plotting facility.  With this release, Octave does
    not require a specially modified version of gnuplot, so gnuplot
    sources are no longer distributed with Octave.  For a more
    detailed description of the new plotting features, see the file
    PLOTTING.

  * New plotting commands:

      plot            -- 2D plots
      semilogx        -- 2D semilog plot with logscale on the x axis
      semilogy        -- 2D semilog plot with logscale on the y axis
      loglog          -- 2D log-log plot
      mesh            -- 3D mesh plot
      meshdom         -- create matrices for 3D plotting from two vectors
      contour         -- contour plots of 3D data
      bar             -- create bar graphs
      stairs          -- create stairstep plots
      polar           -- 2D plots from theta-R data
      grid            -- turn plot grid lines on or off
      xlabel, ylabel  -- place labels on the x and y axes of 2D plots
      sombrero        -- demonstrate 3D plotting
      gplot           -- 2D plot command with gnuplot-like syntax
      gsplot          -- 3D plot command with gnuplot-like syntax
      set             -- set plot options with gnuplot syntax
      show            -- show plot options with gnuplot syntax
      closeplot       -- close stream to gnuplot process
      purge_tmp_files -- delete temporary files created by plot command

  * Other new commands:

      ls, dir         -- print a directory listing
      shell_cmd       -- execute shell commands
      keyboard        -- get input from keyboard, useful for debugging
      menu            -- display a menu of options and ask for input
      fft             -- fast fourier transform
      ifft            -- inverse fast fourier transform

  * Strings may be enclosed in either single or double quote
    characters.  Double quote characters are not special within single
    quote strings, and single quotes are not special within double
    quote strings.

  * Command name completion now works for M-file names too.

  * Better help and usage messages for many functions.

  * Help is now available for functions defined in M-files.  The first
    block of comments is taken as the text of the help message.

  * Numerous changes in preparation to support dynamic loading of
    object files with dld.

  * Bug fixes to make solving DAEs with dassl actually work.

  * The command `save file' now saves all variables in the named file.

  * If do_fortran_indexing is 'true', indexing a scalar with
    [1,1,1,...] (n times) replicates its value n times.  The
    orientation of the resulting vector depends on the value of
    prefer_column_vectors.

  * Things like [[1,2][3,4]] no longer cause core dumps, and invalid
    input like [1,2;3,4,[5,6]] now produces a diagnositic message.

  * The cd, save, and load commands now do tilde expansion.

  * It's now possible to clear global variables and functions by name.

  * Use of clear inside functions is now a parse error.

Summary of changes for version 0.70:
-----------------------------------

  * Better parse error diagnostics.  For interactive input, you get
    messages like

      octave:1> a = 3 + * 4;

      parse error:

	  a = 3 + * 4;
		  ^

    and for script files, the message includes the file name and input
    line number:

      octave:1> foo

      parse error near line 4 of file foo.m:

	  a = 3 + * 4;
		  ^

  * New builtin variable PS2 which is used as the secondary prompt.
    The default value is '> '.

  * New file, octave-mode.el, for editing Octave code with GNU Emacs.
    This is a modified version of Matthew R. Wette's matlab-mode.el.

  * Better support for missing math functions.

  * User preferences are now cached in a global struct so we don't
    have to do a symbol table lookup each time we need to know what
    they are.  This should mean slightly improved performance for
    evaluating expressions.

Summary of changes for version 0.69:
-----------------------------------

  * Multiple assignments are now possible, so statements like

      a = b = c = 3;
      a = b = c = [1,2;3,4];

    or

      c = (a = (b = 2) * 3 + 4) * 5

    are legal, as are things that have even more bizarre effects, like

      a(4:6,4:6) = b(2:3,2:3) = [1,2;3,4];

    (try it).

  * Improved parsing of strings (but they still don't work as matrix
    elements).

  * An M-file may now either define a function or be a list of
    commands to execute.

  * Better detection and conditional compilation of IEEE functions
    isinf, finite, and isnan.

  * Replacements for acosh, asinh, atanh, and gamma from the BSD math
    library for those systems that don't have them.

Summary of changes for version 0.68:
-----------------------------------

  * New functions:

      eval  -- evaluate a string as a sequence of Octave commands. 
      input -- print a prompt and get user input.

Summary of changes for version 0.67:
-----------------------------------

  * New functions:

      find -- return the indices of nonzero elements.

  * Zero-one style indexing now works.  For example,

      a = [1,2,3,4];
      b = a([1,0,0,1])

    sets b to the first and fourth elememnts of a.

    Zero-one style indexing also works for indexing the left hand side
    of an assignment.  For example,

      a = rand (1,2;3,4);
      a([0,1],:) = [-1,-2]

    sets the second row of a to [-1 -2]

    The behavior for the ambiguous case

      a = [1,2,3,4];
      b = a([1,1,1,1]);

    is controlled by the new global variable `prefer_zero_one_indexing'.
    If this variable is equal to 'true', b will be set to [1 2 3 4].
    If it is false, b will be set to [1 1 1 1].  The default value is
    'false'.

  * Using the new global variable `propagate_empty_matrices', it is
    possible to have unary andy binary operations on empty matrices
    return an empty matrix.  The default value of this variable is
    'warn', so that empty matrices are propagated but you get a
    warning.  Some functions, like eig and svd have also been changed
    to handle this.

  * Empty matrices can be used in conditionals, but they always
    evaluate to `false'.  With propagate_empty_matrices = 'true', both
    of the following expressions print 0: 

      if  [], 1, else 0, end
      if ~[], 1, else 0, end

  * Octave no longer converts input like `3.2 i' or `3 I' to complex
    constants directly because that causes problems inside square
    brackets, where spaces are important.  This abbreviated notation
    *does* work if there isn't a space between the number and the i,
    I, j, or J.

Summary of changes for version 0.66:
-----------------------------------

  * Logical unary not operator (~ or !) now works for complex.

  * Left division works.

  * Right and left element by element division should work correctly
    now.

  * Numbers like .3e+2 are no longer errors.

  * Indexing a matrix with a complex value doesn't cause a core dump.

  * The min and max functions should work correctly for two arguments.

  * Improved (I hope!) configuration checks.

  * Octave is now installed as octave-M.N, where M and N are version
    numbers, and octave is a link to that file.  This makes it
    possible to have more than one version of the interpreter installed.

Summary of changes for version 0.63:
-----------------------------------

  * The reshape function works again.

  * Octave now converts input like `3.2i' or `3 I' or `2.3e5 j' to be 
    complex constants directly, rather than requiring an expression
    like `3.3 * i' to be evaluated.

Summary of changes for version 0.61:
-----------------------------------

  * Octave has been successfully compiled using gcc 2.3.3 and libg++ 2.3.
    on a 486 system running Linux.

  * The win_texas_lotto function is now called texas_lotto (it's a
    script file, and win_texas_lotto.m is too long for some Linux and
    System V systems).

Summary of changes for version 0.57:
------------------------------------

  * The C-like formatted print functions printf, fprintf, and sprintf
    finally work. 

Summary of changes for version 0.56:
------------------------------------

  * By default, octave prints a short disclaimer when it starts.
    (You can suppress it by invoking octave with -q).

  * You can keep octave from reading your ~/.octaverc and .octaverc
    files by invoking it with -f.

  * When returning two values, eig now returns [v, d] instead of
    [lambda, v], where d is a diagonal matrix made from lambda.

  * The win_texas_lotto function now produces a sorted list.

  * New functions:

      expm -- matrix exponential.
      logm -- matrix logarithm.

Summary of changes for version 0.55:
------------------------------------

  * The following (C-style) backslash escape sequences work in quoted
    strings (useful(?) with printf()):

      \a  bell         \r  carriage return
      \b  backspace    \t  horizontal tab
      \f  formfeed     \v  vertical tab
      \n  newline      \\  backslash

  * Use of `...' at the end of a line will allow a statement to
    continue over more than one line.

  * The names `inf' and `nan' are now aliases for `Inf' and `NaN',
    respectively.

  * New functions:

      casesen -- print a warning if the luser tries to turn off case
                 sensitivity.
      median  -- find median value.
      norm    -- compute the norm of a matrix.
      sort    -- sort columns.

  * New variable, `silent_functions'.  If silent_functions == 'true',
    the results of expressions are not printed even if they are not
    followed by a semicolon.  The disp() and printf() functions still
    result in output.  The default value for this variable is 'false'.

  * New variable `return_last_value_computed'.  If it is 'true',
    functions defined in script files return the last value computed
    if a return value has not been explicitly declared.  The default
    value for this variable is 'false'.

Summary of changes for version 0.52:
------------------------------------

  * Name completion works for function and variable names currently in
    the symbol tables.  Coming soon: completion for names of functions
    defined in script files but not yet compiled. 

  * The initial value of do_fortran_indexing is now false, and the
    initial value of prefer_column_vectors is now true.  Swap the
    values of these variables if you want behavior that is more like
    Matlab.

  * All script files check the number of input arguments before doing
    much real work.

  * The identifiers `i' and `j' are now also names for sqrt(-1).
    These symbols may be used for other purposes, but their original
    definition will reappear if they are cleared.

  * The symbol tables are now implemented with hash tables for faster
    searching. 

  * A small amount of help is now available for most builtin
    operators, keywords and functions.  Coming soon: help for script
    files.

  * Without any arguments, the help command now lists all known
    builtin operators, keywords and functions.

  * Generic parse errors are now signalled by `Eh, what's up doc?',
    which is closer to what Bugs actually says.

  * The who command now only prints variable names by default.
    Use the -fcn (or -fcns, or -functions) switch to print the names of
    builtin or currently compiled functions.

Summary of changes for version 0.51:
------------------------------------

  * Major overhaul of array indexing.

  * The colloc function actually works now.

Summary of changes for version 0.50:
------------------------------------

  * The lsode and dassl functions now return the states only,
    instead of the time and the states, so you must keep track of
    the corresponding times (this is easy though, because you have
    to specify a vector of desired output times anyway).

  * Solution of NLPs with NPSOL now works on the SPARC.

  * New keywords `endif', `endfor', `endfunction', `endif', and
    `endwhile', which allow for better diagnostics.  The `end' keyword
    is still recognized.  All script files have been changed to use
    these new keywords in place of `end'.

  * It is now possible to uninstall Octave by doing a `make uninstall'
    in the top level directory.

  * The Makefiles are much closer to conforming with GNU coding standards.

  * New functions:

      win_texas_lotto  -- produce six unique random numbers between 1 and 50.
      quad             -- numerical integration.
      lu               -- LU factorization
      qr               -- QR factorization
      dassl            -- Solution of DAEs using DASSL.

  * New files:

      THANKS -- A list of people and organazations who have supported
		the development of Octave.

      NEWS   -- This file, listing recent changes.

  * Help is now available at the gnuplot prompt.
