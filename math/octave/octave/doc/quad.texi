@example
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ('f', a, b)
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ('f', a, b, tol)
[v, ier, nfun] = quad ('f', a, b, tol, sing)
@end example

Integrate a nonlinear function of one variable using Quadpack.

Where the first argument is the name of the  function to call to
compute the value of the integrand.  It must have the form

@example
y = f (x)
@end example

@noindent
where y and x are scalars.

The second and third arguments are limits of integration.  Either or
both may be infinite.  The optional argument tol specifies the desired
accuracy of the result.  The optional argument @var{sing} is a vector of
values at which the integrand is singular.

Compute derivative and integral weight matrices for orthogonal
collocation using the subroutines given in J. Michelsen and M. L.
