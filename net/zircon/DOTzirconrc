# This file contains a sample .zirconrc file and explains the options
# that can be set and the effect they have. Th easiest way to do all
# this is to use the configuration panels provided by the zircon
# system itself. The file is in fact a tcl script that is executed by
# zircon when it startsup.
#

# set nicks {
# 	{YourNick}
# 	{AnotherNick}
# 	{AndAnother}
# }
# nicks holds a list of nicknames you like to use on IRC. The first
# item in the list is the one that wil be used when connecting to a
# server.

# set ircnames {
# 	{An IRC Name}
# 	{Another IRC Name}
# }
# ircnames holds a list of ircnames you like to use on IRC. The first
# item in the list is the one that wil be used when connecting to a
# server. You cannot change the value of your ircname without
# reconnecting to the server.

# set servers {
# 	{server.irc.org}
# 	{another.server.irc.org Port}
# 	{me.too.irc.org Port {opername operpw}}
# }
# servers contains a lits of servers you use. The first one in the
# list is the one that zircon will try to connect too when it starts
# up. Other fields that can be set are port number and IRC operator
# name and password. You will not normally use these. if opername and
# password are set then they will be sent to the server when you
# connect to make you an irc operator (assuming they are valid.....)

# set channelInfo {
# 	{#hottub {menu} {} {} {} {} {} {} {}}
# 	{#hotsex {open close menu} {!JOIN !LEAVE !MODE !QUIT !TOPIC}
# 	  {} {} {} {} {{My Favourite Topic}} {}}
# }
# channelInfo holds information about your favourite channels. The
# easiest way to set it up is to use the Channels configuration panel.
# This allows you to set uo all the fields, excpet for the topic field
# which can be altered directly from the channel itslef using the
# Topic menu.

#
#--------------------------------------------------
# Variables that control the Channel Listing process

# set showPublic 1
# showPublic controls whether or not public channels are shown in the
# listing. 1 means show, 0 don't show

# set showLocal 1
# showLocal controls whether or not local channels are shown in the
# listing. (local channels have names that start with an & rather than
# a #). 1 means show, 0 don't show

# set showPrivate {0}
# showPrivate controls whether or not private channels are shown in the
# listing. 1 means show, 0 don't show This is a pretty useless
# facility but is there because it is in irc II!!!

# set topicOnly 0
# If topicOnly is set to 1 then only channels with a topic set will be listed.

# set minMembers 3
# Only channels with >= minMemebers will be listed

# set listPattern {.*}
# Only channels whose names match this pattern will be listed. The
# patterns are full regular expressions rather than "glob" type
# patterns. They are fully documente din teh tcl manual or in the manual
# page for the regexp command. The pattern .* matches everything.

# set topicPattern {.*}
# Only channels whose names match this pattern will be listed.
# Patterns are as above.

# set noRefresh 1
# If noRefresh is set to 0 then Zircon will do a channel LIST when it
# starts up. This is not recommended!!

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variables that control messages and dialog boxes

# set signoff {I run Zircon}
# This is the message that gets sent when you quit IRC.`

# set noConfirm { QUIT LEAVE KILL}
# Certain zircon actions cause dialog boxes to be popped up. It is
# possible to indicate that for certain of these you always wish to
# conform the action. Possible values are :
#	QUIT	- always quit IRC when the quit button is pressed
#	LEAVE	- always leave the channel when the leave button is pressed
#	KILL	- always carry out KILL operations
#	SAVECONF- always quit zircon without updating confifguration file

# set toInfo {ERROR SIGNOFF INFO}
# Certain information messages can appear either in channel windows or
# as pop up windows. It is possible to divert some of these to the
# zircon information window. Possible values are:
#	ERROR	- error messages are sent to info rather than a pop up
#	SIGNOFF	- When users quit do not indicate this in the channel
#		  windows to which they have been talking.
#	INFO	- Send the output of the server INFO request to the
#		  information window.
#	STATS	- ditto for the STATS command
#	LINKS	- ditto for the LINKS command
#	CTCP	- ditto for CTCP replies

# set verboseCTCP 0
# If verboseCTCP is 1 then information about CTCP messages iwll be
# sent to the informmation window

# set helpService ""
# This variable should contain the nick of an IRC help service. Help
# messages will be sent there by the Help button.

# set killPath 1
# If you are receiving server messages then if killPath is set to 1
# then the path will be removed from KILL messages.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Variables that control window behaviour

# set popInfo 1
# If popInfo is 1 then the information window will pop up when
# something appears in it, assuming that is that it has been closed!

# set noPopup 0
# If noPopup is set to 1, the name and icon for iconified channels
# will be altered when input appears in them, rather than the window
# popping up.

# set friendsOn 1
# If friendsOn is set to 1 then the friends panel will only only show
# those friends who are actually on IRC.

# set history 30
# history contains the default number of lines that will be saved as
# history for each window. You can override this on a per channel
# basis.

# set closeTime 120
# closeTime is the number of seconds before a window that has the pop
# down option selected will close itself. This is configurable on a
# per channel basis. This feature is disabled if the value is 0.

# set popUp 0
# If popUp is 1 the default for channels is that they will pop up when
# new input appears in the window.

# set popDown 0
# If popDown is 1 then the default for channels is that they will
# close their window after closeTime seconds.

# set noJump 0
# If noJump is 1 then windows will *NOT* scroll to the end when new
# input arrives. This is useful when you are looking back through the
# history.

# set quiet 0
# If quiet is 1 then no attempt will be made to ring the bell when a
# bell character arrives. Bell characters are echoed to the channel as
# the string BEEP underlined so that you can see who did the beeping....

# set noMessage {JOIN LEAVE TOPIC QUIT MODE KICK KILL}
# It is possible to turn off various messages that are sent to
# channels when things happen. These can be overridden on a per
# channel basis.
#	JOIN 	- messages when people join channels
#	LEAVE	- messages when people leave channels
#	TOPIC	- messages indicating the topic has changed (The topic
#		  is always visible for a channel so you dont miss
#		  changes if you dont have this message)
#	QUIT	- messages when people QUIT irc.
#	MODE	- messages when there are mode changes
#	KICK	- messages when people are kicked from channels
#	KILL	- messages when people are killed from IRC.

# set aways {
# 	{Meeting}
# 	{Telephone}
#	{Coffee Time}
# }
# Useful away messages for the Away menu

# set actions {
# 	{despairs}
# 	{smiles}
# 	{giggles}
# 	{bingles}
# }
# Useful actions for the Action menu on channels.

# set invisible 0
# set wallops 0
# set srvmsg 0
# These, if set to 1, set you as invisible, get you wallops or get you
# server messages. You dont really want any of these do you?

# set services {
# 	{veg-bot {} {HELP}}
#	{nickname server {MENU ITEMS}
# }
# services contains a list of service providers you talk to regularly.
# The first item in each sub-list is the nick of the service, the second
# item is the server where it is to be found so that security can be
# maintained (it can be {} though) and the third item is a list of
# commands that can be sent to the service. noteserv and nickserv are
# already built into zircon so you dont need to add them.

# set userInfo {
# 	{Nick}
# 	{Nick2 {notify}}
# }
# This variable holds the list of your friends. If the second item in
# the sub-list contains "notify" then you will be notified when they
# log in and out. If friendsOn is 1 ALL friends are assumed to be
# notifiable. 


# ignore {fis!*@*demon.co.uk} notices public invites wallops notes ctcp others
# This command allows you to ignore various messages from users. Set
# it up from the People configuration panel.

# on JOIN {.+ nlfm!.+@.+} \
#	{if [operator $onPar0] { sendIRC MODE $onPar0 +o nlfm} }
# on JOIN {.+ ScottM!.+@.+} \
#    {if [operator $onPar0] {sendIRC MODE $onPar0 +o ScottM}}
# This allows you set up on conditions.
#
#	on JOIN {Pattern List} {action}
#
#
# This will add it to the ons list for you. The Pattern List holds
# full regular expressions NOT glob style patterns. Patterns are
# matched case insensitively. The first pattern for JOIN
# matches channel name and the second matches nick!user@host. When a
# match is found the variables onPar0 and onPar1 are set to the values
# that were matched. Other events can be matched but are currently
# undocumented. The most useful is perhaps STARTUP. This will be
# executed when you connect to a server. It takes no patterns:
#
#	on STARTUP {} {actions...}
#
# in order to write an action you have to know how Zircon works
# internally. A more user friendly interface will be provided in the future.

#
# zbind {} <Meta-q> {doQUIT}
# 
# This sets up a keybinding such that when you type Meta-Q you will
# quit zircon. Thsi binding will be available in all your channel
# windows. If the first parameter is set to be a channel name then the
# binding will take effect only for that channel. The sequence is
# exactly the same as a tk bind sequence and the action requires you
# to understand the internals of zircon.......

#----------------------------------------------------------
# Other stuff
# set smiley :-)
# set frown :-(
# set wink ;-)
# These can be generated by keyboard shortcuts - set them to your
# favourite strings.

#set busyMessage {I am busy and not accepting messages.}
# Set this to the string you want sent to people when you are busy and
# they try to message you.

#set trust(draw) {.*}
#This variable must be set if you wish to use the Sketch Pad feature.
#This setting allows anyone to send you sketches. You can chnage this
#to a list of full regular expressions matching nick!user@host format.
#N.B. I repeat FULL regular expressions NOT glob expressions as used
#in IRCII. Read the tcl manual to find out about these if you dont
#know about them.
