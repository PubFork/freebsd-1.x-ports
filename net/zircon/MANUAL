ZIRCON Version 0.44Beta

This is a getting started document which will eventually turn into the
full Zircon documentation.....

The Windows
-----------

There are two usual windows - the Information window (where some
messages appear) and the Control window where various operations can
take be made to take place.

To join a channel type its name in the entry box at the bottom of the
Control window and finish with Return. Assuming that you are allowed
access to the channel a window for the channel will appear. Click in
the entry box at the bottom of the window to send to the channel.

To send to the channel just type and finish with Return. If you
terminate the line with Escape rather than it will be sent as an
action to the channel.

To leave a channel just click on the Leave button.

To send a msg to a user on a channel, press on the button with their
name on it to the right of the channel window and a menu will appear.
Select Msg from this menu and a new window will be created. This is a
conversation window and is used exactly like a channel window, except
that communication is only with the named user. Clicking on Leave will
dismiss the window.

To send a message to a user *not* on a channel with you use the Users
menu on the control panel.

When a user sends a message to you a new window will pop up and you
can type to it just like a channel and the conversation will proceed.

Most of the other stuff you can do is pretty obvious!

You will at times see various dialog boxes that contain information or
ask for input or confirmation of something. Some of these can be
disabled - look at the file DOTzirconrc and create your own .zirconrc
based on it.

Look at the file zircon.ad for some information on the X resources that
it is useful to set.
