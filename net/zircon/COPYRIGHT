This program was developed as an independent project to satisfy a need
of the authors.  This program may contain bugs and the user is cautioned
independently to verify that the program is suitable for the user's
intended purpose. The program is made available on an ``as is'' basis
with all faults and without any implied or expressed warranties or
support from either the authors, Lindsay F. Marshall and Jon Harley,
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne or anyone else.

We are putting this program in the UNIX domain.  You are free to use
it as you wish.  In return we ask two things.  First, that you do not
remove the names of the authors from this work.  Secondly, if you 
make changes or improvements to this program that you pass these
changes back to the author so that everybody can benefit from the
improvements.
