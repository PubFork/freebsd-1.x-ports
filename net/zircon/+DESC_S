Zircon Release 1.14
-----------------------

This is a release of Zircon, an X11 interface to Internet Relay Chat.
The software is written in tcl/tk and uses the tcl-dp TCP extensions
to provide network communications. Beta testers are asked to provide
comments on the interface that the system provides and to test it
under of a variety of conditions. Please resist the temptation to hack
the code. We will reach a stable, proper release quicker if we can
centralise changes to the program, however suggestions for
improvements in the code will also be welcome. We are particularly
interested in making the system useful for those users in groups where
JIPS and other national character sets are used.

Zircon was implemented as a way of learning tcl/tk and has taken a
very short time to get to its current state of development. It has
more features than you could possibly imagine and implements nearly
everything that the irc II clients support as well as many other
useful and interesting features. This reflects the power of tcl/tk
*not* the fact that I am a wonderful programmer (I am, but that is a
side issue :-)) tcl/tk is a wonderful system and you need it on your
machine *NOW*.
