# FSP startup file (.fsprc)

# slightly easier to remember names for the various FSP sites

# Notes:
#   *	the first argument to `macro' is the macro name; the second is the
#	help text to be used with it -- this is so it is possible to label
#	macros and find out what it does with `help name'
#   *   open takes 3 arguments -- host, port, and home directory
#	failure to specify the last 2 arguments gives defaults of 21 and /
#   *	preceeding a command by `@' ensures that the builtin version is
#	used -- a macro `open' could be defined to be something completely
#	different and these macros would still work...
#   *	macro's are terminated by a `.' at the start of a blank line
