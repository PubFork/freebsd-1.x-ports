This package contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk
called Tcl Distributed Programming (Tcl-DP).  Tcl-DP adds TCP and IP
connection management, remote procedure call (RPC), and distributed
object protocols to Tcl/Tk.  A C interface to the RPC primitives is
also provided.  Unlike the "send" command of Tk, Tcl-DP does not
require that Tcl/Tk processes that want to communicate share an X
server because Tcl-DP is built directly upon TCP/IP.
