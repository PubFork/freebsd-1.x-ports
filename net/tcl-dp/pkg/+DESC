This distribution contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk
called Tcl Distributed Programming (Tcl-DP).  Tcl-DP adds TCP and IP
connection management, remote procedure call (RPC), and distributed
object protocols to Tcl/Tk.  A TCL-DP aware version of the Tk Windowing
Shell (wish) is provided, and is called `dpwish'.
