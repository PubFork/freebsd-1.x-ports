This is the University of Minnesota's Internet Gopher distribution for
UNIX machines.  Here's a breakdown by directory:

doc:          The documentation for all parts of the distribution.
              Look here *first*.  Important files:
                   INSTALL   -- Installation instructions
                   *.changes -- Stuff that's changed from version to version
                   *.doc     -- extra documentation.
                   man pages, etc.

gopher:       The Internet Gopher Curses client.

gopherd:      The Internet Gopher data/directory/index/sound Server.

misc:         various shell scripts/gateways and such...

examples:     A directory ready to drop into a gopherd server
              directory.  If you want the wais index you will have
              to run the script build-index in the appropriate directory.
