UNIX & VMS Step 1a. 
    All of the variables that you are likely to change are in the
    userdefs.h file.  There are a few that you must change or verify, and
    a few more that you will probably want to change.  The variables that must
    be changed are marked as such in the userdefs.h file.  Just edit it
    and the changes should be straight forward.  

    NOTE: Many of the variables in userdefs.h are now configurable in
	  the lynx.cfg file.  Please read the lynx.cfg file as well.

UNIX & VMS Step 1b. (optional)
    Set up local printers and downloaders 
    in the lynx.cfg file.  (see lynx.cfg for details)

UNIX & VMS Step 1c. (optional)
      If you would like to enable PASV FTP code then
      edit WWW/Library/Implementation/HTFTP.c and
      comment out line 43 like so:
      /*  #define LISTEN   /* @@@@ Test LJM */

UNIX Step 1d.  (Optional, sorry no VMS support for this step, skip to step 2)
    Adding Direct WAIS support.
    Get the freeWAIS distribution from sunsite.unc.edu, or ftp2.cc.ukans.edu
    and compile it.  The compile process will create some libraries, you will 
    need wais.a and client.a.  Edit the Makefile in the top level  directory 
    and add the library locations under the DIRECT WAIS ACCESS heading.  
    Edit the Makefile for the WWW Libarary in the
    WWW/Libarary/Implementation/CommonMakefile to make the WAIS.c sources
    in the library.  If everything goes well you should
    be able to make and have direct WAIS access.

UNIX Step 2.
    VMS users skip to 'VMS step 2'

     You should be ready to compile!

    If you type "make" with no arguments you will see a list of 
    supported systems.  If your system type IS listed you just
    need to type "make SYSTEM_TYPE".  For instance, if you are
    running under IBM's RS/6000 AIX 3.2 you would just type
    "make aix32".  If you were running Ultrix you would type
    "make ultrix".

    If you are on a SUN workstation and do not have 'gcc' you 
    may change 'gcc' to '/usr/5bin/cc' in the Makefile

    If you are on a system that is not listed in the makefile
    it may be more difficult. The first thing you should try is just 
    "make generic", this will compile with the "fancy_curses" option, and will 
    give a much nicer screen display.  If it doesn't compile or if the screen 
    display looks strange (real strange), try compiling with the "low_curses" 
    option.  Edit the Makefile and remove the '-DFANCY_CURSES' definition
    under the 'generic:' entry.  There may be some compatibility 
    problems on some systems, but I don't know what they might
    be at this point.  If you are running on a currently unsupported system 
    please contact me at "lynx-help@ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu"  If there are
    any problems I will try to fix them as soon as possible.  

VMS step 2.
    There is a very nice "build.com" script written by Foteos Macrides
    (macrides@sci.wfeb.edu).  All you have to do is type "@build"
    and answer one question about your system.  Current choices
    are:   MultiNet (default)
	   UCX
	   Wollogong.

    The script will auto sense if you are on Alpha OpenVMS.
 
  (optional compilation method)
    If you have and want to use "mms" Set default to WWW.Library.vms 
    and look at the descrip.mms file for details on its use.  
    After mms has built LibWWW return to this directory and
    type one of the following to compile the Lynx sources:
       $ MMS/MACRO=(MULTINET=1)                for VAXC - MultiNet
       $ MMS/MACRO=(WIN_TCP=1)                 for VAXC - Wollongong TCP/IP
       $ MMS/MACRO=(UCX=1)                     for VAXC - UCX
       $ MMS/MACRO=(MULTINET=1,DEC_C=1)        for DECC - MultiNet
       $ MMS/MACRO=(WIN_TCP=1,DEC_C=1)         for DECC - Wollongong TCP/IP
       $ MMS/MACRO=(UCX=1,DEC_C=1)             for DECC - UCX

        If you just type "mms" it will revert to the multinet configuration.
        mms will build the Lynx sources and link in the WWW library.

        The Wollagong support is untested!  Anyone with Wollagong
        wish to help?  (I have included some untested mms files, try them out)


UNIX Step 3.
    Go ahead and test it out.  You shouldn't need to install Lynx to test
    it.  There are several sample files in the samples directory, to view them
    type "./lynx samples/start.html" (UNIX) from this directory. 
    (on VMS you will have to define lynx as a command and then type 
    "lynx start" from the samples directory). 
    From there you can test the local file, WWW, and gopher functions 
    of Lynx.  Once you are satisfied that it works, go ahead and install it.

	VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!
	    If you are setting up an anonymous account with Lynx you
	    are strongly advised to use the -anonymous command line
	    option.  If you do not use this option, users may be able
	    to gain access to all readable files on your machine.

VMS Step 3. 
    Go ahead and test it out.  You shouldn't need to install Lynx to test
    it.  There are several sample files in the samples directory, to view them
    try 'lynx == "$dua?:[whatever]lynx.exe"'
    sd .samples
    then 'lynx start.html'

	VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!
	    If you are setting up an anonymous account with Lynx you
	    are strongly advised to use the -anonymous command line
	    option.  If you do not use this option, users will be able
	    to gain access to all readable files on your machine.

UNIX Step 4. (Installation)
    Lynx is very easy to install, if you want Lynx installed anywhere 
    besides "/usr/local/bin", with the man files in "/usr/man/man1", you 
    need to edit the Makefile and change the "exec" and "doc" defines.
    Otherwise just "su" to root and type "make install" and make will
    copy "lynx", "lynx.cfg" and  "lynx.1" to the specified directories.  
    Those are the only to files necessary to run Lynx.  
    lynx.1 isn't really necessary, but it should be available.
    lynx.cfg isn't absolutely neccessary either but is the only way
    to configure printers and downloaders, so it is highly reccommended.

VMS Step 4.
    Your on your own for installation, you just need to move
    the executable to a public place and make it accessable,
    and copy lynx.cfg to "Lynx_Dir".

UNIX & VMS Step 6. (Hopefully Optional)
    If something doesn't work, or you can't get it to compile at all, or
    you can't figure out what one of the defines means, or if you just
    want to send a comment.  Send me a message by mail, or call me on the phone.
    (You'll find my address and phone number at the bottom of this document.)
    Until Lynx has been ported to all the worlds operating systems, I expect
    there will be some compatibility problems.  For operating systems that we
    do not support at this campus, you may need to grant temporary access to a 
    similar system for testing.
