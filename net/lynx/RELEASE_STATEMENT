    The following new features have been added/changed:

Please see http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/lynx2-3.html
for more details on new features.

* Revamped the FTP code to recognize different server types and to parse
  full directory listings (LIST output).  File types, sizes and dates
  are displayed when possible.
* Popup menus are now supported for non-multiple <select> lists.
* Added "action=" handling to ISINDEX tags.  (Is that in the spec?)
* Fixed (added) the delete-a-bookmark command and bound it to 'r' for remove.
  (thanks to David Trueman for the fix)
* added transparent support for X Mosaic bookmark files.  Just point
  Lynx at your existing default X Mosaic bookmark file in the O)ptions
  menu and Lynx will handle the rest.  Viewing, addition, and removal 
  of hotlist items are supported.
* fixed Telnet security problem
* added second line of reverse video to show multiline links better.
* Added configurable MIME types and viewers to lynx.cfg.  MIME types
  and VIEWERS can be configured by following the instructions within
  the newest lynx.cfg file.
* Added .mailcap and mailcap support as well as mime.types support
  for the configuration of viewers and extension mappings.
  The test command is now implemented so that viewers can be conditionally
  setup.  Either the lynx.cfg method or the mime.types/.mailcap method
  may be used for configuration.
* Added second %s argument to PRINTER and DOWNLOADER definitions.
  If a second %s is present in the command definition it will be
  filled in by a suggested filename which is derived from the URL
  of the document.  See lynx.cfg for more details.
* Got code from CERN to fix HTBTree FTP bug.  Large ftp lists should
  not crash anymore.
* Added no_proxy environment variable.  Set it to a comma delimited list
  of domains or hosts that should not be proxyed. (Thanks CERN :)
  USAGE: (UNIX)
     setenv no_proxy "domain1.dom, domain2.dom, domain3, etc"
* Lynx now exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION on UNIX systems
  with the current version number as the value.
* Fixed Referer: field handling so that it doesn't crash on really
  long URL's
