    The following new features have been added/changed:

Please see http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/lynx2-2.html
for more details on new features.

* Interruptable I/0 now completely works.
  Just hit a 'z' anytime during a transfer to abort.  
  If there is a partial file to show, it will be shown.  
* bold and emphasis now use curses underlining to represent
  ephasized text.  The use of _underline_ chars before and after
  the text is now removed.
* added new more informative messages for form links and transfers.
* added 'd' for download current link.  Can be used to force a download
  of any file.
* Command keys are now completely configureable through the
  lynx.cfg file. (thanks go to David Trueman)
* 'r' removed as a comment key.  Use 'c' to comment or reconfigure 
  your keys to add 'r' back in.  (I would like to use 'r' in the 
  future to mean remove current bookmark link)
* Added support for HTTP redirection.  (I haven't tested it
  heavily because I don't know of many servers using
  redirection, so let me know if something breaks)
* Added Referer: header to HTTP request to specify the
  URI of the document from which the URI in the request
  was obtained.  This allows a server to generate lists of back-links 
  to documents, for interest, logging, etc. It also allows bad links 
  to be traced for maintenance.
* fixed -dump and -source options so that they work for
  binary files.
* Added NNTP posting capibilities.  Currently uses external inews
  program which will be included in the utils directory.
  Would someone like to patch in some freeware inews code?
* Added configurable download menu so that binary files may
  be downloaded using any protocol.  Download menu is displayed
  after selecting a non-displayable file.
* added configurable character sets.  Can be set in lynx.cfg,
  by the user in the options screen, or in the users .lynxrc file
  current sets are: ISO Latin I, DEC Multinational, IBM PC Character set, 
  & 7 bit approximations.  New sets can be added to src/LYCharSets.c
* slight change in forms user interface.  For the better I hope you will
  agree.  Text input fields are now active as soon as the cursor pointer
  is over them.  Therefore you may begin typing into the text field
  as soon as you come to it.  Tab, and up and down arrow keys will
  move off of the text input field.  Return will also move to the
  next link.  The only problem with this is as follows.  
  If you are in the habit of using the number keys (keypad)
  the or h,j,k,l VI keys, as soon as you move over the text link
  you will begin seeing numbers or hjk or l show up in the text field.
  In other words, your movement commands are now broken :(  You must
  use true arrow keys, return or the tab key to move off of the text field.
  I've tried this out and it seems to work alright.  I don't think
  that users unfamiliar with this will have too hard a time figureing
  it out.  Once you see numbers or letter appearing it becomes fairly
  obvious whats going on.  Lynx puts a message at the bottom of the
  screen saying "use tab or arrow keys to move off of link."
* added mods by David Trueman to implement -restrictions commandline
  option.  -restrictions allows a list of services to be disabled
  selectively. -restrictions takes the form of
  "lynx -restrictions=[default],[all],[inside_telnet],[outside_telnet],[shell],\
	[editor],[bookmark],[option_save],[print],[file_url],[download],[exec]"

   all             restricts all options.
   default         same as commandline option -anonymous.  Disables
	           default services for anonymous users.  Currently set to,
	           all restricted except for: inside_telnet, outside_telnet, and
	           goto.  Defaults settable within userdefs.h
   inside_telnet   disallow telnets for people coming from inside your
		   domain.
   outside_telnet  disallow telnets for people coming from outside your
		   domain.
   shell	   disallow shell escapes
   editor	   disallow editing
   bookmark	   disallow changing the location of the bookmark file.
   options_save    disallow saving options in .lynxrc
   print           disallow most print options
   goto            disable the 'g' (goto) command.
   file_url        disallow using G)oto to go to file: URL's
   download        disallow saving binary files to disk in the download menu.
   exec            disable execution scripts
   exec_frozen     disallow the user from changing the execution link
		   setting in the O)ptions menu.
* Added command line option -show_curser.  If enabled the curser
  will not be hidden in the right hand corner but will instead 
  be positioned at the start of the currently selected link.
  show curser is the default for systems without FANCY_CURSES
  capibilities, and the default configuration can be changed in
  userdefs.h
* fixed bug in password handling which cuased it to be displayed
  accidentally :(  (Danny Mayer)
* Added exec links.  4 types currently defined: (* compiled out by default! *)
    files ending in:  .csh, .ksh, .sh, (for UNIX)  and .com (for VMS);
  Use exec link controls to turn on and off exec links.
* Gopher menues are now within <pre> so that spaces are not
  collapsed in menu entries.
* Ability to FTP to VMS systems. (Foteos Macrides)
* Lynx FTP now supports PASV code. (fixes to CERN (Dave Raggert?) PASV code
  from John Ellson)  It is not enabled by default.  Line 43 in
  WWW/Library/Implementation/HTFTP must be commented out for
  PASV code to be used.  This was done because not all FTP sites
  can support PASV FTP.
