Lynx PROBLEMS file.

I hope that you will never have to read this, but inevitably problems
do arise.  As implimentation and installation problems become known
they will be outlined in this file.

    The handling of textarea feilds in HTML forms is not
    completed.  Only one input line will appear.  I am
    working on code to fix this.

    Lynx cannot read all ftp sites.  There exist some sites where
    the ftp format is non standard and is currently unparsable.
    Send a message if you think you have encountered one.

    Links within documents of the type 'URL#selector' do not work
    when the document is specified like this: "file:/PATH/FILENAME"
    They will work if the document is specified like this:
    "file://localhost/PATH/FILENAME"

    Using "lynx -cache=1" may cause a crash due to a realloc error.
    Please use a cache larger than 1.

    Screen resizeing is a little bit funny.  If you resize the screen, 
    documents that have been cached will be out of whack.  Any further 
    documents will look fine.  This is a curses program anyways, so 
    resizeable terminals are not that common.  On some systems 
    (i.e. HP/UX) terminal resizing does not work at all.
    You can reload documents to the current window size with CTRL-R

    The Sun `shelltool' and `cmdtool' terminals are stupid by default.  
    In order to get bold text to appear differently than inverse video, 
    the user should put this line in ~/.Xdefaults:

        Term*boldStyle:         Offset_X

    From the `shelltool' man page, it seems to me that an analogous line 
    in ~/.defaults

        /Tty/Bold_style "Offset_X"

    ought to work just as well, but I wasn't able to get the desired
    behavior until I modified my .Xdefaults file (and ran `xrdb
    ~/.Xdefaults').  Note also that there are other supported values 
    for the boldStyle resource/Bold_style default, all of which begin 
    with "Offset_". (helpful hint from kevin@traffic.den.mmc.com)

    Deleting a link from a bookmark file causes Lynx to crash on some
    systems.
