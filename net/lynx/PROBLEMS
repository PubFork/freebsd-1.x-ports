Lynx PROBLEMS file.

I hope that you will never have to read this, but inevitably problems
do arise.  As implimentation and installation problems become known
they will be outlined in this file.

    The handling of textarea feilds in HTML forms is not
    completed.  Only one input line will appear.  I am
    working on code to fix this.

    There is a bug in WWW/Library/Implementation/HTBTree.c
    Lynx may crash when reading large FTP listings.  This bug will
    bite when reading the mirrors/msdos directory at wuarchive.wustl.edu

    Lynx cannot read all ftp sites.  There exist some sites where
    the ftp format is non standard and is currently unparsable.
    Send a message if you think you have encountered one.

    Links within documents of the type 'URL#selector' do not work
    when the document is specified like this: "file:/PATH/FILENAME"
    They will work if the document is specified like this:
    "file://localhost/PATH/FILENAME"

    Using "lynx -cache=1" may cause a crash due to a realloc error.
    Please use a cache larger than 1.

    The screen resizeing is a little bit funny for WWW documents.  If
    you resize the screen, any WWW documents that have been cached will
    be out of whack.  Any further documents will look fine.  This is
    a curses program anyways, so resizeable terminals are not that common.
    On some systems (i.e. HP/UX) terminal resizing does not work at all.
