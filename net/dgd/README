   This is release 1.0.a7 of DGD.  Many things have changed since the
previous release.  A summary of mudlib-affecting changes:
 - When used from the auto object, call_other(), clone_object() and
   find_object() will no longer invoke driver->path_object() to
   translate the path.
 - The first argument has been removed in calls to driver->path_ed_read(),
   driver->path_ed_write() and driver->path_object(), since it was always
   the same as previous_object().
 - Dumping state is now done with dump_state(), rather than swapout(1)
   or shutdown(1).
 - The predefined macro __VERSION__ has been removed; instead, the version
   number has become a field in the array returned by status().
 - The fields of the array returned by status() (as well as the generated
   include file status.h) have been reorganized.
 - intp(), stringp(), objectp(), arrayp() and mappingp() have been replaced
   by a single kfun, typeof().
 - Callouts work differently: call_out() returns an integer value > 0,
   which must be supplied as an argument to remove_call_out().  The kfun
   find_call_out() has been removed.  status(obj) returns a list of callouts
   for an object.
 - editor() now returns the output as a string, rather than calling
   receive_message() in the editor object.
 - driver->connect() has been renamed to driver->telnet_connect().
I've modified the 2.4.5 simulation so it works with 1.0.a7 (the 2.4.5
simulation is not included in this distribution, but is also available at
ftp.lysator.liu.se, directory /pub/lpmud/drivers/dgd).

   Config file affecting changes:
 - port_number renamed to telnet_port.
 - Added binary_port.
 - Renamed swap_sector to sector_size.
 - Renamed swap_cache to cache_size.

   Also, a float type has been added, many bugs were fixed, and part of the
compiler was rewritten (probably introducing some new bugs).
   Some docs have been added or changed.  The conditions for commercial use
are stated in doc/Commercial.
