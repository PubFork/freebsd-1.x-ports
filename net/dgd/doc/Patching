   Before making any changes to the program, please read the file Copyright
in the dgd directory.  I will not allow any code copyrighted by others
to be part of DGD proper, and I reserve the right to modify any patches and
bugfixes sent to me, to make them suit my particular style of indentation,
variable and function naming, and commenting.  I will definitely remove all
comments of the form /* bar-bug fixed by foo */.  If you don't like this,
it suits me fine if you limit it to a bugreport, rather than a bugfix.

   People who want to make serious additions to the driver (for instance,
networking kfuns) should write a separate package.  If I like your package, I
may decide to support it, and distribute it together with DGD.  Such packages
should ALWAYS have their own copyright.
