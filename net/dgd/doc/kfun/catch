NAME
	catch - catch errors in code

SYNOPSIS
	string catch(expression)


DESCRIPTION
	Execute the code for <expression> until an error results, or until
	execution is complete.  If an error resulted, catch() will return
	the error message as a string; otherwise, it will return 0.
	If catch() is used by the driver object, the allowed execution cost
	will be reset to maximum.

ERRORS
	A limited number of nested catches is allowed.  The limit is
	implementation-defined, and should be sufficient for ordinary
	purposes.

SEE ALSO
	kfun/error, kfun/lock()

NOTE
	catch() is not a real kfun.  catch(a, b) will evaluate the expression
	(a, b), rather than "call catch() with arguments a and b".
