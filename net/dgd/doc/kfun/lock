NAME
	lock - lock code

SYNOPSIS
	type lock(expression)


DESCRIPTION
	Execute the code for <expression>, without execution cost limitations,
	and with some extra space on the function call stack.  The return
	type is the same as the type of <expression>.  lock() can only be used
	by the auto object.

SEE ALSO
	kfun/catch

NOTE
	lock() is not a real kfun.  lock(a, b) will evaluate the expression
	(a, b), rather than "call lock() with arguments a and b".
