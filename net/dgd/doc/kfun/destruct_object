NAME
	destruct_object - destruct an object

SYNOPSIS
	void destruct_object(object obj)


DESCRIPTION
	Destruct the object given as the argument.  Any value holding the
	object will immediately change into 0, and object will cease to exist.
	If an object destructs itself, it will cease to exist as soon as
	execution leaves it.

ERRORS
	Objects destructing themselves may not do certain things between the
	time of destruction and the time the object will cease to exist.  Most
	notably, call_other() may not be used from destructed objects.
