NAME
	clone_object - clone an object

SYNOPSIS
	object clone_object(string obj)


DESCRIPTION
	Call path_object() in the driver object to translate the string
	argument into an object path, and create a copy of the specified
	object with an unique name of the form "object_path#1234".  If the
	specified object is unloaded, it is compiled first.  The new object
	is returned.

ERRORS
	If the number of existing objects is equal to the constant MAX_OBJECTS,
	defined in the include file <limits.h>, attempting to clone a new
	object will crash the system.
	Calling clone_object() with the name of a clone as an argument will
	result in an error.
