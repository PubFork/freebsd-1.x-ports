NAME
	call_out - call function with delay

SYNOPSIS
	varargs int call_out(string function, int delay, mixed args...)


DESCRIPTION
	Call a function in the current object with a delay.  The function to
	be called must not be private.  The delay is specified in seconds.
	The minimum delay is 1 second; if the given delay is less, it is
	changed into 1 second.
	The returned value is the callout handle, an integer > 0 which
	must be used if the callout is to be removed.

ERRORS
	If the total number of active delayed calls in the system is equal to
	the constant MAX_CALL_OUTS, defined in the include file <limits.h>,
	attempting to add another one will result in an error.
	If MAX_CALL_OUTS is set to 0, no delayed call will be added, and no
	error will be caused.
