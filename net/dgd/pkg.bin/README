(packaged for FreeBSD by Ydgwys, adam@veda.is)

It is necessary to edit the 'lpmud' file to use suitable values for
"telnet_port" and "binary_port".

To run the driver once only, do 'bin/driver lpmud' (or equivalent).
To run the driver so that it gets restarted automatically if the MUD crashes
   or is shutdown, do 'rundgd &'.
The mud should be run by the mud user, so it might be convenient to do
"echo 'rundgd &' | su mud"

When a driver is running, it should be possible to use telnet, pmf, or some
other client to login to the MUD on the telnet port specified in the config
file.

DGD MUDs known to be open as of January 1994 are:

The Pattern: [129.16.50.30] epsilon.me.chalmers.se 6047 (DGD development site)
IgorMUD:     [129.16.60.9]  ny.mtek.chalmers.se    1701 (good typical LPmud)
Albion Mud:  [193.4.230.1]  mud.veda.is            4000 (play and development)
PaderMUD:    [131.234.2.42] mud.uni-paderborn.de   3000 (enchanting, realistic)

All 4 have a more or less medieval theme.

Other sites are also developing their own special mudlibs with DGD.
