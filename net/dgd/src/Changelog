DGD 1.0.a0

Differences with LPmud 3.1.2:

Language:

 - No keywords "protected", "public" and "status".
 - Mappings, as in the mappings package that I made for LPmud, with one
   difference: there is no m_delete(), and the normal way to remove an
   index/value pair from a mapping is to set the value to 0.
 - Typechecking is more strict.  As in LPmud 3.1.2, functions are not
   typechecked if they have no declared type, but it is possible to enforce
   typechecking in all objects.
 - call_other() does not require a cast.  If the type is not clear from the
   context, a cast is recommended.
 - Types such as int**, string***** are possible.
 - Initializers are not supported.
 - Indexing out of range is not allowed on arrays and strings.  Negative
   indices can be used to offset from the end of the array/string (-1 last,
   -2 last but one, etc).
 - Indexed string assignments such as foo = "bar"; foo[0] = 'B'; are possible.
 - The zero size array and zero size mapping are not globally shared, and
   comparisions such as array == ({ }) will fail.
 - It is illegal to declare any functions, function prototypes or variables
   before inheriting.
 - Inheritance is completely different.  There are two kinds of inheritance,
   virtual and labeled.
   Virtual inheritance is the default.  If A is inherited by B and C, and D
   inherits B and C, then the variables of A are in D only once.  It is illegal
   to inherit two different functions with the same name, unless function F1 is
   inherited in the object that defines function F2, or if at least one of
   F1 and F2 is private.  It is illegal to inherit two different variables
   with the same name, unless at least one of them is private.  It is
   illegal to redeclare a non-private variable.  Private functions are
   private in the program that defines them, and cannot be used from inherited
   objects.  Private functions do not mask inherited functions, except in
   the program in which they are defined.  It is illegal to inherit two
   different instances from an object.
   Labeled inheritance uses the syntax inherit label "file"; Functions in
   labeled inherited objects can be accessed with  label::function();
   Variables in labeled inherited objects cannot be accessed from the
   current program at all.  Functions and variables need not be unique
   between labeled inherited objects.  It is possible to inherit the same
   object with labeled inheritance twice; the different instances will not
   share their variables.
 - There is an object that is automatically (virtually) inherited in all other
   objects, called the auto object for short.  The auto object is shared
   even between virtual inherits and labeled inherits.
 - Predefined functions are called kfuns (kernel functions); the kfuns and
   the non-private functions declared in the auto object together are called
   efuns.  Kfuns are assumed to be static functions inherited in the auto
   object, with the added limitation that they cannot be called with
   this_object()->kfun().  All static functions declared in the auto object
   share this limitation.
 - There is no class_specifier inherit "file"; This did not work in LPmud 3.1.2
   anyhow.
 - Function prototypes are always inherited together with the function.
 - Function calls are typechecked if the called function is typechecked.  It
   is illegal to call a non-varargs function with the wrong number of
   arguments from a typechecked function, even if the called function is
   not typechecked itself.
 - Kfuns are not treated differently from other inherited functions, so
   destruct(this_object(), this_object()); will not cause a compile-time
   error in an untypechecked function.
 - Inherited functions may be redeclared with a different prototype.  If
   an inherited function is redeclared with a prototype only, and the function
   itself is not declared in the same program, then all calls to the function
   from that program will call an undefined function, which will result in a
   runtime error.
 - If object A declares function F, and B has only a prototype for function
   F, calls to F from B will call function F in A if A and B are inherited
   in the same object.
 - It is illegal to inherit a function and a prototype for the same function
   if the prototypes do not match.
 - A call to an undeclared function from an untypechecked function implicitly
   declares a prototype for the undeclared function that matches anything.
 - this_object()->function(); can be used to call static functions, but not
   private ones.
 - foo->bar(gnu); is merely an alias for call_other(foo, bar, gnu);  It is
   therefore possible to redefine call_other() entirely.
 - lock(expr); will evaluate expr without regard of execution cost, and with
   extra space on the function call stack.  It can only be used by the auto
   object to ensure that execution does not halt inside a critical function.
 - Any kfun can be redefined, just as ordinary inherited functions can.
   catch() and lock() are not considered to be kfuns (they are not true
   functions because catch(foo, bar) does not "call catch with two arguments").

Compiler:

 - The built-in preprocessor conforms to the ANSI standard, except for the
   following:
    - No trigraphs.
    - Successive string constants are not concatenated (use the + operator
      instead).
    - The suffixes U and L are not allowed on integer constants.
    - No floating point constants.
 - There is a standard include file which is included automatically.
 - All #pragma directives are ignored.
 - All integer constants may be in decimal (starting with 1-9), octal (starting
   with 0), hexadecimal (starting with 0x) or a character constant 'x'.  The
   only escaped characters that are translated into something else in
   character constants and string constants are \t and \n.
 - The compiler is two-pass.  In the first pass, the function is typechecked
   and a parse tree is constructed.  Constant folding and removal of dead
   code is done.  In the second pass, code for a virtual stackmachine is
   generated.  Jumps to jumps are optimized.  Optionally, the second pass
   may generate C code (not yet implemented).

Interpreter:

 - The interpreter has only 32 instructions.  Kfuns are not part of the
   interpreter proper.
 - Objects are pure programs.  They do not have inventories, environments,
   are not alive, do not have actions (all of this can be simulated).
 - Pathnames without a leading slash are considered to be relative to the
   directory of the current object (i.e. /foo for the object compiled from
   /foo/bar.c).
 - create() is called if a function in an object is called for the first
   time.  It is not called if an object is loaded because it is inherited.
   If it is desired that reset(0) is called instead, add the following to
   the auto object:

	void reset(int arg) { }

	nomask void create()
	{
	    reset(0);
	}

 - reset() is never called by the driver.  Both reset on reference and reset
   after a fixed period are easily simulated.
 - clean_up() is never called by the driver.
 - Text typed by a user is passed on by calling receive_message(text) in the
   interactive object.  The kfun send_message(text) can be used in interactive
   objects to send text back to the user.
 - There is no "master object" as in LPmud 3.1.2, but a "driver object"
   instead (there is nothing masterly about it in DGD).  It is used only to
   translate pathnames for #include and inherit, and to supply the object
   that is used for interactive connections.  It does not inherit the
   auto object, unless this is done explicitly.
 - There is no shadowing.
 - The default state of an object is swapped out.  Strings and arrays are
   only shared inside objects.  If an array is exported from one object to
   another, it will become a different array as soon as the object is swapped
   out (this is guaranteed never to happen during execution).
 - Self-referential datastructures will be deallocated when no more outside
   references exist, because they do not belong in any object.

Kfuns: DGD has about half of the kfuns of LPmud 3.1.2:
 - No kfuns such as environment(), this_player(), add_action().  Simulate them
   if you want them.
 - There is no exec(), heart_beat(), wizlist() (simulate them).
 - No parse_command().  It cannot be simulated, so people might want to port
   it to DGD, but it will never become part of "pure" DGD.
 - No alist kfuns.  I prefer mappings, even if alists are more powerful.
 - All file kfuns are unprotected.  To get either native or compat mode
   security, make the proper redefinitions in the auto object.
 - The built-in editor uses a temporary file and is very close to ex.
 - call_other() is typechecked if the called function is typechecked.  Calling
   a function that does not exist results in an error if the call has
   arguments (I still have to think about this).
 - There are no optional flag arguments to any kfun.

DGD 1.0.a1

 - ALLOCA() and AFREE() have replaced some instances of ALLOC() and FREE(),
   and be used to allocate memory with alloca(), if available on the host.
 - Mappings are now partially hashed.  If a mapping grows by assigning to
   an index/value that doesn't exist yet, the index/value pair is stored in
   a hash table.  Mappings are converted to sorted arrays of index/value
   pairs when swapped out.
 - Fixed some bugs in the compiler, interpreter and kfuns.
 - Changed the way line numbers are stored.  The interpreter no longer
   maintains the current line number at runtime.
 - Added int-only versions of some kfuns to speed up integer arithmetic in
   typechecked programs. Typechecked functions are now typechecked at runtime
   as well, to ensure that integer arguments are really integers.

DGD 1.0.a2

 - Better dead code removal.
 - Mixed return values are cast to int if needed.
 - Lvalues as function arguments are now handled properly.
 - Fixed a problem with (exp1, exp2) in aggregates and function arguments.
 - More untypechecked expressions are optimized.
 - String constants are marked as such.
 - Driver object has been enabled.
 - It is now illegal to call any function with too many arguments, even if the
   function has class vararg.
 - I removed the error on call_other() to a non-existing function.
 - When an object is cloned, or a function is called in it for the first time,
   create() in the object will be called.  
 - Added config file which is read on startup.
 - All ANSI escape sequences are now recognized in string constants and
   character constants.  Fixed a bug with #arg in macros.
 - Created proper main loop that reads input and calls receive_message() for
   the associated objects.
 - Created (single user) comm package.  DGD now works as a regular game driver.
 - Overview of functions called by the gamedriver (can be static):
   In the driver object:
    * void initialize()
	Initialize the mudlib.  Called once at program startup.
    * string path_ed_read(object, string)
	Path translation for editor read.
    * string path_ed_write(object, string)
	Path translation for editor write.
    * string path_object(object, string)
	Object path translation (for find_object, clone_object, etc).
    * string path_inherit(string, string)
	Inherit file name translation.
    * string path_include(string, string)
	Include file name translation.
    * object compile_object(string)
	Called if the given argument could not be compiled.  The driver
	object can return an object that will be renamed to the wanted
	object.  The returned object may be a clone, and will remain
	a clone (i.e. may not itself be cloned), even with the new name.
	Modelled after "virtual objects" in MudOS, the American LPmud brand.
    * object connect()
    * void log_error(string, string, string, int)
	Log a runtime error.
    * string compile_log(string)
	Return the name of the file to which compile time errormessages
	should be appended.
   In the user object:
    * void open()
	LPmud: login
    * void close()
	Called if the user connection to the mud is closed.
    * void receive_message(string)
	Called for user input.
   In an object that uses the editor() kfun:
    * void receive_message(string)
	Called for editor output.
 - Overview of the kfuns added:
    * varargs mixed call_other(mixed, string, ...);
    * object this_object();
    * varargs object previous_object(int);
	Return the previous object n+1 steps back in the call_other chain.
    * object clone_object(string);
    * void destruct_object(object);
	LPmud: destruct()
    * string object_name(object);
	LPmud: file_name()
    * object find_object(string);
    * string function_object(string, object);
	LPmud: function_exists()
    * object this_user();
	LPmud: this_player(1);
    * string query_ip_number(object);
    * object *users();
    * int strlen(string);
    * mixed *allocate(int);
    * int sizeof(mixed *);
    * mixed *map_indices(mapping);
	LPmud + mappings: m_indices()
    * mixed *map_values(mapping);
	LPmud + mappings: m_values()
    * int map_sizeof(mapping);
	LPmud + mappings: m_sizeof()
    * int intp(mixed);
    * int stringp(mixed);
    * int objectp(mixed);
    * int arrayp(mixed);
	LPmud: pointerp()
    * int mappingp(mixed);
    * void error(string);
	Cause an error.
    * void send_message(string);
	Send a message to the current object (should be interactive user),
	messages from the user will call receive_message() in the object.
    * int time();
    * varargs void call_out(string, int, ...);
    * int remove_call_out(string);
    * void shutdown();

    * void editor(string);
	Handle an editor command, such as "e file", "%s/foo/bar/g", "x".
	If no editor instance exists for the current object, it will be
	created; editor output will call receive_message() in the object.
    * string query_editor(object);
	Return the editor status of the object ("command", "input" or 0).
    * void save_object(string);
	LPmud: save_object() without .o tagged on.
    * int restore_object(string);
	LPmud: restore_object() without .o tagged on.
    * varargs string read_file(string, int, int);
	LPmud: read_bytes()
    * int rename_file(string, string);
	LPmud: rename() (limited, will not rename directories if the
	       host doesn't support this)
    * int remove_file(string);
	LPmud: rm()
    * varargs void write_file(string, string, int);
	LPmud: write_bytes(), will append if third argument is omitted.
    * int make_dir(string);
	LPmud: mkdir()
    * int remove_dir(string);
	LPmud: rmdir()
    * mixed **get_dir(string);
	Get file info using get_dir(file), directory info using
	get_dir(dir + "/" + pattern), the pattern can have ? * [a-z].
	The return value has this form:
	    ({ ({ names }), ({ mod times }), ({ sizes }) })
	This is almost compatible with MudOS, except that directories have
	size -2 (non-existing files and special files are not included).

    * varargs string crypt(string, string);
    * string ctime(int);
    * string *explode(string, string);
    * string implode(string*, string);
    * int random(int);
    * varargs int sscanf(string, string, ...);
	As in LPmud, but also handles %*s (skip assignment), %s%d and %%.

DGD 1.0.a3

 - Replaced objkey with separate fields in both objects and values.  Structure
   alignment on sun4 systems caused the size of a value to be 12 bytes, where
   it should have been 8.  It should now be 8 bytes on any host (as long as
   uindex is an unsigned short, and pointers use 4 bytes).
 - Redeclaring an inherited function with different parameters is now allowed
   (runtime typechecking will handle calls from inherited objects to the new
   function), but the return type still has to match.
 - Fixed a bug with the return type of an implicit prototype, which should
   read as mixed, when used.
 - Some checks to see if the result of path_file() was NULL were missing.
 - Removed time_interval from the configuration parameters.  If I'm going to
   support call_out intervals of less then a second, I'll do it in a different
   way.
 - The simulated rename() erroneously removed the destination if it existed.
 - Some checks for destructed this_object() in kfuns removed.  Either the
   error is caused from path_object(), or there was not real reason to block
   the kfun (file I/O).  Doing a call_other() from a destructed object is still
   illegal.
 - Special files are no longer excluded from a get_dir() listing.
 - Fixed some bugs in the compiler, where functions from different inherited
   objects were confused.
 - The type of the objcnt field in the value struct has been changed into
   Int, to save space on hosts that have 64-bit longs.
 - Replaced all variables called "index" by "idx".  index() is a function like
   strchr() on some systems.  Sigh.
 - Fixed a bad bug in integer comparisions.
 - The call_outs configuration parameter now specifies the maximum number of
   call_outs in all objects together, rather than per object.
 - The maximum execution cost is now set to the appropriate value at runtime
   (25% for call_outs), rather than once at initialisation.
 - call_out() and remove_call_out() now work.  The gamedriver is fully
   functional for a single user.
 - DGD now automatically generates a file called "limits.h" in the first
   include directory, which describes the sizes of datatypes and resources.
 - Fixed a problem with dumping function call traces of destructed objects.
 - Fixed several bugs in get_dir() and path_resolve().
 - Fixed a bug which occurred if a variable was defined with a name that had
   been used in an inherited object.
 - Destructing a destructed object gives an error, rather than a fatal error.
 - call_other() from a destructed object no longer results in an error, but
   is simply ignored, like in LPmud.

DGD 1.0.a4

 - TCP/IP support added.
 - Reduced the amount of runtime stack checking, by computing in advance (an
   estimate of) the maximum stack depth of a function, which is checked when
   the function is called.  This takes two bytes extra per function.
 - Indexed string assignments will not make a copy of the string, if the string
   is not a constant and has reference count 1.
 - Fixed several bugs in the interpreted code generator.
 - Added LPC->C code generator.
 - Cleaned up Makefiles and including files a little bit (still far from
   perfect).

DGD 1.0.a5

 - Removed some redundant code from restore_string().
 - this_user() was not always 0 in call_outs.
 - call_other() to a function with the wrong number of arguments does not cause
   an error, even if the function is typechecked.  This was already so for
   version 1.0.a3, but slipped from the log.
 - Fixed some typecasting errors in str_range() and arr_range().
 - Instances of an object on the stack were not properly wiped out when the
   object was destructed.
 - Fixed a bug in the C code generator, which didn't remove errorcontexts
   properly.
 - catch() within lock() no longer turns off the lock.  If used by the driver
   object, code within catch() will run with the execution cost reset.
   initialize() in the driver object will no longer be called with a lock.
 - Fixed a bug in remove_call_out, which could instead remove a similar
   call_out in an object that was already destructed.
 - It is now possible to redefine an inherited typechecked function as
   untypechecked.
 - Fixed a bad bug which caused the wrong inherited object to be used as the
   program in a function call.
 - map_sort() will now remove index/value pairs with the value set to 0.
 - Check exec cost if a creator function is about to be called.  This prevents
   half-initialized objects due to exec cost problems.
 - Fixed a bug in the < <= > >= operators on strings.
 - Max exec cost in call_outs is now 1/2 instead of 1/4.
 - Fixed a bad memory leak in array.c .
 - Exchanged the place in the array returned by get_dir() of the file sizes
   and the file mod times; it is now ({ names, sizes, times }).  It used to be
   different for compatibility with MudOS, but their doc turned out to be
   faulty. :)
 - Changed comm.c to handle INTR and DEL in telnet.
 - Fixed a bug in restore_object(), which would get stuck in an infinite loop
   when restoring an object without saveable variables.
 - Swapping enabled.
 - Fixed a bug that caused a bad program index in a function call to be
   generated.
 - Fixed a problem having to do with a full input buffer in comm.c .
 - Fixed a bug in save_object and restore_object, where the offset of variables
   in inherited objects was not properly calculated.
 - Fixed a memory leak in the generation of prototypes by calling undefined
   functions (only in untypechecked objects).
 - String hash table sizes are now powers of two.  They used to be primes,
   which is fairly pointless in this implementation.
 - Divided allocated memory into 'static' and 'dynamic' memory.  Static memory
   is used for things which need to be kept when everything is swapped out,
   and dynamic memory is used for the rest.
 - Fixed a bug with escape sequences in the preprocessor, and a related bug in
   the parser.
 - this_user() is now set during the call to open() in the user object.
 - Fixed bugs in the C code generated for catch() and ?:.
 - Inheritance with a label no longer specifies that a different type of
   inheritance is required (!).  Functions may now be inherited more than once,
   as long as the inheriting object redefines them.  A label can still be used
   to specify which inherited instance of a function is to be called.
 - Negative indexing has been removed.  Sorry, but I added them without
   considering the arr[0 .. x-1], with x = 0 problem.  (If only indices
   started at 1 instead of 0...)
 - Fixed a memory leak in mappings with destructed objects for indices/values.
 - Fixed a bug with destructed objects as arguments to call_outs.
 - Fixed a cleanup problem in case an object could not be compiled.
 - New kfuns:
    * get_exec_cost()
	Return the allowed execution cost that is remaining.
    * varargs int *status(object)
	Return status information.  The 'fields' of the returned array are
	described in the automatically generated include file "status.h".
    * void swapout()
	Swap out all objects.

DGD 1.0.a6

 - Fixed a problem in kfun/debug.c in case RUSAGE was defined, but DEBUG was
   not.
 - Included size of tables in O_PROGSIZE, as given by the status() kfun.
 - Fixed an overflow problem in integer case ranges.
 - Renamed config option "reserved_stack" to "reserved_cstack", and added
   "reserved_vstack".
 - Both the renaming of and the renaming to the auto object and the driver
   object is now illegal.
 - Repeated call_others to the same function are now faster on average.
 - The control blocks of precompiled objects are swapped out no longer.
 - Fixed a bug in the editor substitute command, which could mess up if
   substitutions occurred and didn't occur on alternate lines.
 - Fixed a possible memory leak in restore_array and restore_mapping, in
   case the save file was faulty.
 - Fixed a bug with global integer variables as lvalue arguments to sscanf()
   in typechecked functions.
 - Improved some compiler error messages.
 - A new prototype for an inherited function won't replace the inherited
   function anymore, if the prototypes are identical.
 - Function calls with too few or too many arguments no longer cause runtime
   errors.  It caught a lot of errors, but also broke some code which
   shouldn't have.
 - Fixed a bug in inheritance, which could fail if two inherited objects
   defined the same function, and a third was unloaded.
 - Fixed a bug in calls to functions for which an undefined prototype was
   inherited, but which were redefined.
 - Changed _time, _ctime, _opendir, _readdir, _closedir and _alarm into
   P{_*} to make it work on HP systems.
 - Telnet GA is now only sent after a (possibly empty) prompt, and not
   after any finished output.
 - Made BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF and CR host-independent.  Moved the adding
   of CR before LF back into comm.c (was in host/unix/connect.c in version
   1.0.a5).
 - State dumps:
   swapout() and shutdown() now take a numeric argument.  If non-zero,
   a state dump is created on the file specified by the dump_file config
   parameter.  A state dump file can be used on startup (by specifying it
   as the 2nd argument) to restore from.  After a successful restore,
   driver->restored() is called, rather than driver->initialize().  User
   objects and editor objects are not restored as such, and the driver
   object should deal with them in restored().  This can be done by
   registering those objects, just before the state dump occurs.
 - Ellipsis can now be used to declare a function with arbitrary numbers
   of arguments.  Example:

	varargs string sprintf(string format, mixed args...);

   args will have type mixed*, and will be an array with the additional
   arguments.  Ellipsis can also be used in a call, to push all elements
   of an array on the stack as arguments:

	call_other("/some/thing", "foo", array_with_arguments...);

 - Replaced time_t with long everywhere to make things portable.  If a time_t
   doesn't fit in a long on a particular host, it will have to be truncated.
 - Speeded up remove_call_out().  Removing a short-term call_out is now
   reasonably fast.
 - Added find_call_out().  I previously left it out because I considered
   using it bad programming practice.  I still think so, but it might be
   useful in some rare cases, and the current implementation is fairly fast.
 - All of x[y .. z], x[y ..], x[.. y] and x[..] are now possible, with the
   obvious meanings.
 - The swapfile and editor tmpfiles are now removed on a shutdown.
 - Fixed a bug in the compiler, which would not always cast the result of
   a function call to int when this was needed.
 - Errors inside a catch are now logged on stderr as well.
 - Fixed a problem which occurred when a catch was used in a conditional
   context in LPC->C code.
 - Fixed a problem in the compiler, which could produce a bad symbol table
   for the auto object (which fortunately isn't normally used).
 - If a clash between inherited functions occurs, only the clashing functions
   will be listed, rather than all functions that are inherited more than
   once.
 - Better removal of unused call_out slots in objects.
 - sscanf("foobar","foo%s") will result in an error.
 - New kfun: call_trace().  It returns the call trace as an array (see the
   doc for specifics).
 - driver->log_error() is now called (locked) with two arguments, the error
   string and a flag which indicates if the error is caught.  It should make
   use of call_trace().  The driver itself no longer logs runtime errors.
 - If an object is inherited that itself inherits an object that has been
   destructed, call driver->recompile(obj).  The driver object must destruct
   the object to force it to be recompiled, if this is desired.
 - A missing #endif would not always give an error.
 - Using a void value when typechecking now gives the error "void value not
   ignored" always.
 - Added mapping - array and mapping & array.
 - Functions with a declared non-void type must return a value.
 - Variables could erroneously be redeclared as private in the same object.
 - Redeclaration of an inherited function or variable will now give the
   inherited object in the errormessage.

DGD 1.0.a7

 - Fixed a bug with saving large numbers in arrays and mappings.
 - Improved memory allocation in case sizeof(long) > 4.  Also improved
   efficiency for the case that DEBUG is not defined.
 - String hash tables are no longer cleared before being deleted.  Some hash
   tables used by the compiler which were previously statically allocated are
   now dynamically allocated.
 - The >> and << operators now shift unsigned values, so the result is
   identical on all hosts.
 - Fixed a memory leak in i_index() and i_index_lvalue().
 - Comm.c can now deal with ^Z as well.
 - Cleaned up the inheritance logic in control.c, and removed some bugs.
 - Fixed several bugs in the restoring of object names.
 - Fixed some code in switch_str(), which would only work properly for the
   auto object and driver object.
 - Replaced longs by Ints in the editor, to save space on hosts with
   sizeof(long) > 4.
 - Fixed a bug in c_tst() and c_not().
 - Changed the alarm/timeout interface.  co_call() now calls P_timeout()
   to determine if an alarm timed out; co_timeout() has been removed.
 - main() is now in local.c, and should call dgd_main(argc, argv).
 - All occurrances of fprintf(stderr, ...) replaced with P_message(...) .
 - path_object() (call_other, clone_object, find_object) from the auto
   object will no longer call the driver object to translate the path.
 - Fixed yet another problem in the C code generated for catch().
 - Added function name comments to generated C code.
 - The class specifier private no longer implies static, for variables.
   This means that private variables can be saved with save_object(), and
   restored with restore_object().  To get the old behaviour, use both
   static and private.
 - A new kfun is added, dump_state().  swapout() and shutdown() no longer
   do a state dump through a flag argument; dump_state() should be used
   instead.  dump_state(1) will create an incremental dump on top of an
   old one.
 - Fixed a possible memory leak in sscanf().
 - Fixed a bug in src/host/unix/connect.c which could hang the driver.
 - Made IAC GA optional.  The client must request it with IAC DONT TELOPT_SGA,
   which the driver will respond to with IAC WONT TELOPT_SGA.  I badly
   underestimated the number of faulty clients, and even plain telnets could
   not handle it.
 - Editor marks and secondary buffers were not cleared in between edits.
 - In the editor, changing a line into nothing could cause a crash.
 - Added a float type.  Fairly useless for muds, but not for other
   applications.  Everything has been adapted (save_object, sscanf), but
   apart from floatp no kfuns have been added yet.  Four new builtin kfuns,
   ADD1, ADD1_INT, SUB1, SUB1_INT have been added.
   The float type has 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 36 mantissa bits.
   The format is basically a truncated IEEE double, with a few alterations:
   exponent 0x7fff is illegal, and there is no gradual underflow.
 - Fixed various minor bugs in the compiler.  Also made runtime typechecking
   more strict, and improved optimisation.
 - The dataspace of destructed objects that are not freed for some reason
   is now deleted right away.
 - The object argument has been removed from driver->path_ed_read(),
   driver->path_ed_write() and driver->path_object().
 - intp(), floatp(), stringp(), objectp(), arrayp() and mappingp() have
   been replaced with a single kfun, typeof().
 - The swapfile is not created before sectors are actually written to it.
 - A float.h file is now created on startup.
 - Added 2nd swapout measure for last five minutes.
 - Renamed config parameter swap_sector to sector_size.
 - Added some kfuns: fabs(), floor(), ceil(), fmod(), frexp(), ldexp(), modf().
 - Floats (both global and local) are initialized to 0.0, rather than integer 0.
 - Added time of compilation to control block struct.
 - Callouts have been changed: call_out() now returns an integer > 0, which
   must be given as an argument to remove_call_out() to remove it.  The kfun
   find_call_out() no longer exists.  status(obj) gives a list of all callouts
   in an object.
 - Renamed port_number to telnet_port, added binary_port (dummy, for now).
 - Reorganized status() and limits.h .
 - Fixed several bugs in the handling of callouts, which could result in random
   memory trashing.
 - Fixed some bugs in control.c for sizeof(int) == 2.
 - Fixed a bug in the swapping of large mappings.
 - Some more editor bugs fixed.
 - In the editor, use of | is restricted to inside global commands.
 - editor() no longer sends output to receive_message() in the editor object,
   but returns it as a string.
 - The optimizer has been made a separate part of the compiler.
 - dump_state() changed again: it will now sync the swapfile, append some
   tables at the end, and move it to a dump file.  Afterwards, the driver will
   read from the dump file to reconstruct the swap file at low priority.
   Incremental dumps no longer exist.
 - The swapfile was not always created before a dump was made, resulting in
   a fatal error.
 - float.h and float.c have been renamed to xfloat.h and xfloat.c, respectively.
 - The maximum stack depth of a function call with one argument was not
   computed correctly.
 - Multiple inheritance of the same file in different ways could, in some
   cases, lead to invalid fcall and variable offsets.
 - Fixed a bug that caused spurious stack overflow errors.
 - Fixed a problem with expressions of the form (a) ? (b, c) : d.
 - Dead code is now silently thrown away, instead of resulting in a
   "statement not reached" error.
 - Changed #include "float.h" to #include "xfloat.h" in generated C code.
 - Fixed a bug in the optimizer which mangled sscanf() assigned value checks.
 - The replies to DO TELOPT_SGA and DONT TELOPT_SGA were accidentally reversed.
 - Lexical errors were repeated for each rescanning of the input.
 - Some improvements in the typechecking for mixed... .
 - Enabled binary port.
 - Fixed a bug with # define foo "gnu.h" \n # include foo
 - Some bugs in binary connections fixed.
 - Fixed a bad bug in comm.c which could hang the driver.
 - Fixed a newly introduced lexical scanner problem.
 - get_dir("/a/b") returned "a/b" as the name of the file, instead of "b".
 - Oops, several private variables with the same name would each be saved with
   save_object().  Private for variables made to imply static again.
 - Filename matching in get_dir() made more efficient (thank you, Aedil).
 - Fixed a bug in && and || used as standalone expressions.
 - Dump files now include a kfun table.  This enables the driver to restore
   a dump file that was made by a driver version with fewer kfuns.  As long
   as no kfuns are removed and the interpreter itself is not changed, dump
   files can be used with future driver versions.
 - Let (x, 0) match any type but float in situations where 0 would.
 - The command line restore file argument is taken to be relative to the
   current directory at the time, rather than relative to the mudlib directory.
 - Makefiles brought up to date.
 - (int) 0.0 yielded a wrong value.
 - Max execution cost is no longer halved during a callout.
