'lpmud' is the 2.4.5 configuration file for testing, and '../lpmud' is the
2.4.5 configuration file for normal running. The port numbers and the filenames
for "ed_tmpfile", "swap_file" and "dump_file" should be different between the
two 'lpmud' files so that there is no conflict when running a production driver
and a test driver simultaneously. There should be no problems running the two
drivers from the same mudlib, but refrain from posting notes on the boards or
mailing from the post office in the test driver, in case of possible conflict
while the production driver is running.

For a real MUD with lots of objects, some of the default values will have
to be raised, in order to avoid the game aborting when a limit is reached.
