   DGD != LPmud, but without LPmud DGD could not have existed.  My effusive
thanks to Lars Pensjö for putting me on the right track.

   Many valuable suggestions were provided by Johan Andersson, Jacob Hallen
and especially Pär Winzell, who convinced me that objects do not require
builtin inventories or actions.

   Richard Braakman showed me in practise that using hashing for object symbol
tables is very worthwhile.
