Ytalk-3.2 - Notes for FreeBSD users
===================================

to compile and install ytalk, type

xmkmf -a
make all
make install

and enjoy!!!

Changes to ytalk for it to run on FreeBSD (it should also work
on NetBSD I think) mainly relate to the fact that the ntalk
protocol uses the old 4.3BSD struct sockaddr_in, while the
struct sockaddr_in used by 386BSD derived systems is different,
and is probably closer to 4.4BSD
