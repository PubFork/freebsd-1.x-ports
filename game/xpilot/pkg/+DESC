XPilot is a multi-player tactical manuvering game for X and Unix workstations.
Players have a fighter which they move along in an artificial world
and shoot each other using various kinds of weapons like bullets, mines,
smart missiles, heat seekers and so on.  It is a fast paced game with
a lot of tactics.  There are also robots flying around shooting players
and other robots.  Players can pickup special bonuses to improve the
possibilities of their ship like more engine power or special weapons.
The aim of the game is to score points and to have a lot of fun.

People can create their own maps using either a standard text editor or
a nifty map editor with easy-to-use graphical user interface.
Nice maps are a popular item to share with others.

The game is very configurable in that you can specify many parameters
in a defaults file, in the map file or on the command line.  Configurable
options include the speed of shots, the lifetime of shots, the force and
direction of the gravity, whether players can use shields or not, the chance
that some kind of special bonus appears in the world, the number of screen
updates per second and so on.
