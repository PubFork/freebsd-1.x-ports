These level files are used in the X11 game called XBoing. They are a simple
ascii level data file that is read in at run time as needed.

Please see the documentation that comes with the game for more information
on the file format for these levels.

Use the newlevel.data file as a template for new levels. Also remember to 
change the define value in blocks.h MAX_LEVEL_NUM to include your new levels.
