DESCRIPTION
     _X_B_o_i_n_g is a blockout type game where you have a paddle which
     you control to bounce a ball around the game zone destroying
     blocks with a proton ball.

     Each block carries a different point value. The more  blocks
     you  destroy,  the  better  your  score. The person with the
     highest score wins.

     The arena is filled with blocks and other objects. You  have
     a  paddle  that can move from left to right at the bottom of
     the arena. You control the paddle so that  the  proton  ball
     bounces  around  blowing  up  blocks and that it does not go
     past the paddle and out the  bottom,  much  like  a  pinball
     game.


BLOCK TYPES
     The blocks exhibit different behaviour. The bomb block  when
     hit will explode all other blocks around it. If another bomb
     is beside it then it will explode also. The solid wall brick
     will  not  explode  unless next a bomb. The ammunition block
     will give you four bullets and so on. Special blocks such as
     reverse and machine gun will only last for one ball/level.

     There is also a unlimited ammo block that will enable unlim-
     ited  ammo  for  that level. You will always have bullets to
     shoot with. Cool.

     There are random blocks that change their colour and  there-
     fore  their  points  every  now  and then. They add a bit of
     interest to the levels.

     There is a  pirate  symbol  that  will  kill  your  ball  if
     touched.  You  can shoot this block 3 times to kill it. Keep
     away from the Death block, it terminates your ball!

     The walls off block will turn the wall bounce  off  on  both
     the  left  and  right  side of the arena. This will mean the
     ball will not bounce off the walls but continue through  the
     wall and wrap around to the opposite side respectively.

     The extra time block will add an extra  20  seconds  to  the
     clock to help you out.

     The reverse block will when hit, reverse the controls to the
     paddle.  This  block  should be avoided as it makes the game
     really  hard.  Hitting  another  reverse  while  already  in
     reverse mode will turn it off. This control mode is reset to
     normal for each new ball.

     The teleport block will teleport the ball somewhere else  on
     that level. It will not place you too close to the bottom of
     the screen or on another block.

     The sticky paddle block will stick the ball to  your  paddle
     each  time  it is hit and wait until you press fire to shoot
     it off again.

     Some blocks will drop from their starting positions and head
     off down the screen until they nearly hit your paddle. These
     are normal blocks except they move... They will not  clobber
     an existing block or move into a ball. Note that their score
     will decrease as the move down the screen!! Get in  early  I
     suspect.

     There is a roaming dude that just roams around the arena. It
     has  logic  to  stop it bouncing into something and will not
     roam off screen! It is worth a few hundred points  and  must
     be killed.

     There is a machine gun block that allows you to  shoot  much
     faster.  Note  that  you  will  also  use  your bullets at a
     greater rate. Can be fun to let off a burst  every  now  and
     then. Erases counter blocks very fast.

     An extra ball symbol may appear and when  hit  by  a  proton

     ball  it will give you an extra ball! You can have a maximum
     of seven balls in store.

     There is a shrink paddle block that will shrink your  paddle
     to  a  smaller size for the level. If you currently have the
     smallest paddle then it has no effect.

     There is also an expand paddle block that will grow you pad-
     dle  to  a  larger size for the level. If you currently have
     the largest paddle then it has no effect.

     You can use the bullets to shoot the last pesky blocks or to
     collect  lots  of  bonus  coins. You will be given 4 bullets
     when a new level starts. If you lose  a  ball  you  will  be
     given a token 2 bullets. Use bullets wisely as you will hate
     yourself when there is one brick left and the ball is  miss-
     ing it for ever.

     Throughout the game the bonus  coins  will  appear.  Collect
     these  for  bonus points awarded when the level is finished.
     Sometimes the coin may appear as a x2  or  x4  symbol  which
     will  indicate  that  the  scoring from then onwards will be
     multiplied by 2 or 4 respectively. Note: if  you  get  a  x2
     then  x4 then x2 you will go back to x2 mode. Also note that
     this x2 or x4 mode will be disabled after each ball death.

     Also during the game some special blocks  will  appear  like
     reverse, death, extra ball, etc. and then disappear like the
     bonus coins. These blocks behave like normal but will disap-
     pear.

     If you collect more than  10  bonuses  during  a  level  the
     killer  mode  is  activated which will turn the ball red and
     the ball will plough through all  blocks  except  the  solid
     ones and finish the level very quickly.

     The bonus screen will tell you how  you  went  in  the  last
     level.  Your bonuses will be added plus the bullet and level
     bonus. You get 500 points for each bullet not used. You  get
     3000  points  for  each  bonus  and  if you get more than 10
     bonuses you get a SUPER BONUS of  50,000  points.  You  also
     receive a new ball every 100,000 points. Pressing space will
     skip the bonus animations when the bonus screen appears  and
     your bonus points will still be added.

     There is a level timer that counts down while  playing  each
     level.  If you don't complete the level in the allotted time
     you will not receive the time bonus which is 100 points  per
     second  remaining.  You  will miss out on the level bonus if
     your time runs out.

     The ball will be automatically shot  off  the  paddle  after

     about  5  seconds  unless  you  press the space bar. You can
     always press `P' to pause the game.

     If the ball gets stuck in an infinite loop it will automati-
     cally tilt the board if the ball hasn't hit the paddle after
     a certain time span. The time span  is  about  8  seconds  I
     think.

     When you get a new ball you will see a small red arc with  a
     moving yellow dot go from left to right and back again. This
     yellow dot indcates the direction of the ball when you start
     it.

     XBoing was started like many other projects  to  learn  Xlib
     better.  I had the XPM library and was already using it in a
     Motif application. I thought that it would be cool  to  have
     nice  colour  pictures/animations in an Xlib game. So I did.
     Without the XPM library I would be still  playing  with  the
     colours I think.


OPTIONS
     The _s_p_e_e_d option will adjust the speed of the overall  game.
     It will except integer numbers between 1 and 9. The speed of
     the game can be changed from within the game  as  well.  See
     Game Control. The default value is warp 3.

     The _m_a_x_v_o_l option allows you to adjust the maximum volume to
     be  used  for  the  sound  effects if sound is supported. It
     doesn't mean all sounds will be this volume  but  they  will
     use that volume as the top volume to scale against.

     The _s_t_a_r_t_l_e_v_e_l option allows you to set the  starting  level
     for  your  games. Note that when your score is placed in the
     highscore table the level number is  the  number  of  levels
     completed  and  not  the level number attained. Also, in the
     bonus screen your level bonus will be the number  of  levels
     completed  multiplied  by  the level bonus value and not the
     current level number! Unless this option is used  the  first
     level will always be level one.

     The _h_e_l_p option will display a brief one line description of
     all the command line options used with xboing.

     The _s_y_n_c option will turn on the X Window System  synchroni-
     sation  of  all  Xlib  calls  which means that all calls are
     flushed by the X server before continuing. This  will  cause
     the  game  to  become  slower but enable some debugging. The
     default is OFF.

     The _u_s_a_g_e option will print a very brief synopsis of all the
     command line options and there value ranges.

XBOING(6)                GAMES AND DEMOS                XBOING(6)



     The _v_e_r_s_i_o_n option prints the version of xboing that you are
     running.

     The _s_c_o_r_e_s option will print both the  roll  of  honour  and
     your  personal best scores to standard out. This can be use-
     ful if you are not  running  the  program  on  an  X  window
     display and still want to see what the scores are.

     The _k_e_y_s option will enable the use of the keyboard for game
     control. Within the game you may press <g> to toggle between
     mouse and key control. The default is MOUSE control.

     The _s_o_u_n_d option will enable sound to be turned on if possi-
     ble. Within the game you may press <s> to toggle sound on or
     off. The default is OFF.

     The _s_e_t_u_p option is useful when you have just  compiled  the
     program.  It  will  display  the  paths of the level & sound
     directories and also give  you  some  information  on  other
     things.

     The _n_o_s_f_x option will turn OFF special effects. The  special
     effect  in  question  at  this stage is the explosion shake.
     Turning it off will speed the game  up  a  little  bit.  The
     default  is  ON.  Servers without backing store will have it
     turn off automatically as the shaking is shocking.

     The _n_o_g_r_a_b option will tell xboing not  to  grab  the  mouse
     pointer  when  the game is visible. Pointer grabbing has the
     effect of stopping you move the  pointer  outside  the  game
     window.  This  is  useful as it constrains the mouse and you
     don't get colourmap flashes. The default is ON.

     The _u_s_e_d_e_f_c_m_a_p option  will  make  xboing  try  to  use  the
     default  colourmap. This will be fine if the default colour-
     map is reasonabily empty (ie: 200 free  colour  cells!).  If
     you  have  a  complex  picture  on your background then this
     option will not work and xboing will be unable  to  allocate
     enough colours.

     The _n_i_c_k_n_a_m_e option allows you to specify a  nick  name  for
     you  instead  of  using your real name found in the password
     file. This can be useful for hiding  your  identity.  Please
     note  that I store the user id in the highscore file and use
     that for checking and sorting. You will  still  appear  only
     once in the global highscore table.

     The _d_i_s_p_l_a_y option will force  the  game  to  be  viewed  on
     another   display.   The  format  of  the  display  name  is
     <xserver:0.0> like most other programs where xserver is  the
     name of the display. The default is your display of course.

     You may also set three environment variables used by xboing.
     They specify the location of the level files, sounds and the
     highscore file. They are listed below.

     These environment variables will override the settings  that
     are compiled into the program.

          XBOING_SCORE_FILE = the highscore file to be used.
          XBOING_LEVELS_DIR = the directory with the levels.
          XBOING_SOUND_DIR  = the directory with the sounds.


GAME CONTROL
     Use the mouse to move the paddle left and  right  by  moving
     the  mouse  left and right. All mouse buttons shoot bullets,
     start ball. The paddle will follow the mouse  pointer.  This
     is the best method and easiest to use by far IMHO.

     Below are the keyboard controls. (Non case sensitive)

          Space   = Start game
          J       = Paddle Left
          K       = Shoot bullet
          L       = Paddle Right
          Right   = Paddle Right
          Left    = Paddle Left
          Escape  = End game and return to introduction.
          i       = iconify the game and pause.
          H       = View roll of honour.
          h       = View personal highscores.
          p       = Pause game.
          d       = Kill the ball.
          a       = Toggle audio on/off
          s       = Toggle special effects on/off
          c       = Cycle through the intro screens.
          1-9     = Game speed where 9 is fastest.
          +       = Increase maximum volume level.
          -       = Decrease maximum volume level.
          t       = Tilt board bumping ball.
          q       = Quit XBoing


SCORING
     Note: Highscores are saved at the end of each game.  If  you
     quit  a  game  while playing your score will be added to the
     highscores.

     Each block has a  point  score.  Some  blocks  such  as  the
     counter  block will have more than one score associated with
     it.

     Each time the paddle is hit  with  the  ball  your  earn  10

     points. I'm nice.

     There is a death symbol (a pirate) that when hit by  a  ball
     will  destroy  your  ball. You can shoot them three times to
     remove them.

     At the end of each level you are awarded a level bouns which
     is  level  <n> x 1000 points. So for level 20 you get 20,000
     points! If you fail to complete the level in the time allot-
     ted you will not receive a level bonus.

     Your score will be adjusted so that players on warp  9  will
     obtain  a better score than players on warp 1 and so on. The
     algorithm is (score / (warp/9).

     XBoing uses two highscore files.  One  displays  the  global
     scores which will be your best score to date. The other is a
     personal high score table with all your attempts (stored  in
     your home directory).

          red = 100
          blue = 110
          green = 120
          yellow = 140
          tan = 130
          purple = 150
          bomb = 50
          wall = 0
          roamer = 400
          drop = row * 100
          specials = 100
          ammo = 50 plus bullets
          counter = 200 (each number).


SOUND SUPPORT
     Xboing has support for sound. It has sound code for the fol-
     lowing machines :-

     HP, SUN, NetAudio, LINUX &  NetBSD  PC  Soundblaster,  RPLAY
     sound system, and DEC Audiofile.

     Most support and use the .au format sound files.  The  linux
     version  just  sends the data down to the audio device which
     may cause slight clicking  sounds  due  to  the  audio  file
     header.   Future  versions  of  xboing  will  support  other
     machines if patches are sent to me or if I learn  the  sound
     format.  I am not going to have heaps of converted files all
     over the place in different formats as the archive would  be
     HUGE.

LEVELS
     The levels are not increasingly harder to play  -  some  are
     but  some  are easy. This is because it takes ages to create
     and design levels.

     The level data is specified in a simple ASCII file that  can
     be  edited.  The  levels  are  loaded when required from the
     directory specified when the game was made.

     You can create more levels if you like making sure that they
     are  in  the  correct  format  and  that they have a correct
     filename.

     Copy newlevel.data to level??.data  and  use  that  for  the
     editing of new levels.

     The format of the level is shown in the  newlevel.data  file
     in the source distribution in the levels directory.

     Make sure you have  a  level  title  and  a  time  bonus  in
     seconds.

     level format: (case sensitive)
