I really hope not ... but ...

Bugs/Darn I wish I had time to :

	Config file documentation could *still* use some sprucing up

	Man pages need to be more useful. Currently, the regular docs are
		real real good, and moving it to *roff format is a waste.
		However, they are functional.

	The messaging facility is broken. We don't know how, but it happened
		and we cannot figure out why. This would be a wonderful
		thing for someone to fix after taking over the code ...

Wish List :

		get rid of newwin.c and make the planet and player windows
			dynamicaly sizing like the score window.

		code could *still* use some more uncrufting in places.

Other than this, it should work. It has been confirmed running on

	Sparc 2, SunOS 4.1.1, cc, MIT X11R4 and MIT X11R5

Confirmed compilable on

	DECstation 3100, Ultrix 4.2, cc, MIT X11R4
	IBM RT, AOS 4.3, hc, MIT X11R4
	Sun 3/60, SunOS 3.5, cc, MIT X11R4
	VAXstation 3100, Ultrix 3.1, cc, MIT X11R4
