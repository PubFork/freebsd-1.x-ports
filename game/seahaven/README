This is Seahaven Towers, a solitaire card game written for X11R4 and
C++.  If you don't have X11R4 and C++, you might as well give up now.

One of the files (the one containing the bitmaps for the cards) is so
huge that it won't conveniently fit in a 64K message.  However, it
compresses real well, so I compressed and uuencoded it before putting
it in the shar file.  (Don't worry, you're not missing much by not
being able to read it directly; it's just a bunch of numbers.)  So,
after unsharing, you need to execute the following three commands:

uudecode < cardbitmaps.uue
uncompress cardbitmaps.C.Z
rm cardbitmaps.uue

After that, you should be able to just run xmkmf and make.  (If you
don't have imake, rename Makefile.noimake to be Makefile, and run
make.)  Of course, I can't guarantee that my C++ code is portable; I
haven't been able to try it on a lot of platforms.  But it shouldn't
be too hard to fix if it doesn't compile.
