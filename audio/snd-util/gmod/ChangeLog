Version 1.1
   Many thanks to Robert Sanders for his excellent MTM & ULT loaders, and his
      numerous great suggestions!

   Additions/changes by Andrew J. Robinson:
      8 channel module support.
      Period table extended to cover more octaves.
      Reduction in the number of global variables.
      Fixed 669 sample loading to load ALL samples.
      Changed read to fread, lseek to fseek, etc.
      Added support for log volume in UltraTracker version 1 files.
      Added support for the panning command.
      "Set Speed" command now converted to either "Set Ticks" or "Set BPM".
      Each note can now have two commands.
      Volume now ranges from 0 to 255.
   Additions/changes by Robert Sanders:
      GUS memory checks/memory reporting.
      MultiTracker (MTM) & UltraTracker (ULT) loaders.
      "Show empty samples" option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First numbered version!  (V1.0)  (Additions/bug fixes by Andrew J. Robinson)
   Made seqbuf_dump more persistent -- if the entire buffer isn't written to
   the queue, it will keep trying.
   Improved pitch slides -- they are now linear with respect to period
   rather than pitch.
   Added "FLT4" module support.
   Added the rest of MOD commands except "set finetune" and "invert loop".
   Added support for tuned samples.
   Fixed 669 playing -- 669 modules should now play correctly, but 669
   effects are not yet supported.
   Changed calculation of speed.  I hope it's right this time :-)
   Added a small calculation to attempt to minimize loop clicking.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date:  23 Dec 1993 (Additions/bug fixes by Andrew J. Robinson)
   Added sync_time after initial set-up.  This may help cure a problem with
   pitch slides sometimes not working.
   Changed the way bad samples are handled.  Now, the channel is turned off
   if a note is played on that channel using a bad sample.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date:  22 Dec 1993 (Additions/bug fixes by Andrew J. Robinson)
   Fixed a misplaced 'if' statement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date:  21 Dec 1993 (Additions/bug fixes by Andrew J. Robinson)

   Added support for arpeggio, tone portamento with vol slide, pattern loops,
   pattern delays, note cuts, note delays, and the "fine" commands.
   Corrected (hopefully) volume slides, pitch slides, and speed command.
   Added code to use "closest note" when period in MOD file does not match
   a period in the table.
   Added checks to reduce the number of MIDI events put in the queue.
   Miscellaneous other small fixes.

Notes:
   The pitch of a note cannot be slid beyond two octaves of its original
   position.  This is a limitation of the Linux sequencer drivers.
