Welcome to GMOD, a music module player for Linux and the Gravis Ultrasound card.

The following module formats are supported:
	4/6/8 channel MOD
	8 channel 669
	MultiTracker (MTM)
	UltraTracker (ULT)

Requirements:
	Linux kernel configured with GUS sequencer drivers.  The drivers must 
		be version 2.4 or greater.
	And, of course, a GUS card. :-)

You may use either the binary version (stripped, optimized for 486), or you
may compile the sources yourself by using the included Makefile.

For help, type 'gmod -h'.

Please send any comments, suggestions, etc. regarding this version to me,
Andrew J. Robinson (robinson@cnj.digex.com).
