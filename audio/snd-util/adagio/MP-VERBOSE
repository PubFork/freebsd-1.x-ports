#
# Mp mallocs one chunk of memory to record all the midi
# events in the file -- if space for 125000 events turns
# out not to be enough for some very long pieces, mp could
# be recompiled to allow more.  In this case, you can see
# several lines below that only space for 35556 events was
# required for this particular midi file.
Space for 125000 events has been allocated.
#
# Voices are allocated to devices first-come-first-serve
# with preference given to the external synth, then the
# gus, except when too many simultaneous notes would have to
# sent to a preferable device, in which case mp changes
# its mind.  "Too many" is 8 for the Kawaii K1 and 36 for
# the gus.  Here are the changes that were made to avoid
# exceeding devices' maximum polyphony:
String Ensemble 1 on channel 8 shifted from ext. synth to card.
Distortion Guitar on channel 6 shifted from wave to fm card.
Jazz Guitar on channel 5 shifted from ext. synth to card.
Electric Grand Piano on channel 3 shifted from ext. synth to card.
Closed High Hat on channel 10 shifted from wave to fm card.
Tambourine on channel 10 shifted from wave to fm card.
Electric Grand Piano on channel 3 shifted from wave to fm card.
Overdriven Guitar on channel 13 shifted from wave to fm card.
#
# and the above mentioned number of midi events for which
# memory space was required:
 35556 times and events recorded.
#
# The largest number of notes playing on the gus at one
# time was 36, which exceeds the gus's maximum polyphony
# by 4.  Mp is now set up to permit exceeding the maximum
# by 4, which means a few notes are sometimes going to be
# terminated prematurely.
 36 max gus polyphony.

# These are the gus patches that were loaded, with how much
# of the gus's ram they consumed:

# In phase 1, mp translated raw midi events into an internal
# score -- a list of notes and their attributes.
Phase 1 completed; 5912 note(s), 5638 ctrl(s) have been translated.

#
# Just before starting to play, here are some of the voices playing
# on the midi channels -- it is in general not a complete list.
#
# On channel 1, the General Midi "Acoustic Grand Piano" voice is
# being played through the external midi port on the Kawaii K1.
# It is sent to the K1 channel 1, with left-right stereo panning
# set to center stage:
  channel  1: Piano 1[0,0] to K1 channel 1 at center.
  channel  2: Ac Bass[32,0] to K1 channel 2 at center.
# To the fm card (pas16):
  channel  3: Electric Grand Piano[2,0] on fm at center.
# To the gus sound card:
  channel  4: voices[54,0] on gus at center.
  channel  5: jazzgtr[26,0] on gus at left.
  channel  6: Distortion Guitar[30,0] on fm at center.
  channel  7: Glocken[9,0] to K1 channel 5 at center.
  channel  8: marcato[48,0] on gus at left.
  channel  9: String Ens[49,0] to K1 channel 7 at right.
# Percussion notes are sent to the gus and possibly some to
# the fm card -- in this case only the Tambourine.  The drum
# set is the program message sent for a percussion channel --
# it is treated just like a tone bank.
  channel 10: gus & fm percussion at center (drum set #8).
  channel 11: Airy[100,0] to K1 channel 8 at center.
# prophet1 is a custom gus patch from Franc,ois Dion, configured
# as tone bank 8 of GM voice 63 in my /etc/default.cfg.
  channel 12: prophet1[63,8] on gus at center.
  channel 13: Overdriven Guitar[29,0] on fm at center.
  channel 14: voices[54,0] on gus at center.
#
# The next information is from the driver about the maximum polyphony
# the gus has been set for and the number of different patches it
# can handle:
18 fm voices, 256 instruments.
32 gus voices, 256 instruments.
8 ext voices.

# Here are the numbers of notes which had to be terminated prematurely
# in order to start new notes, because of the limitations of the
# devices.  Conflicts are bad, but when there are only a few, it
# isn't noticeable -- these numbers are modest:
79 fm notes terminated due to conflicts.
2 gus notes terminated due to conflicts.
10 ext notes terminated due to conflicts.
#
# Since mp's count of notes turned on matches the count of notes turned
# off, it is under the impression that none were left hanging.  (This
# may or may not be true.)
Notes on:  gus 8600  fm 7933  ext 1888
Notes off: gus 8600  fm 7933  ext 1888
#
# Mp uses extra notes to simulate chorus depth, but not when this might
# exceed the polyphony capacity of a synth device.  Following is the
# number of such extra notes mp decided not to play.  For the K1,
# all chorus notes have to be dropped out, since mp cannot simulate
# chorus depth on an external synth.
Chorus notes dropped:
           gus 2  fm 49  ext 1888
#
# Here is how the available dynamically allocatable "voices" on the
# devices were used for notes.  If the dynamic allocation routines are
# working well, each available voice should have been used for roughly
# the same number of notes.  First, for the fm card:
