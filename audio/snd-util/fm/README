This is the first release of these tools for FreeBSD.  You should be
able to simply 'make' in this directory and then do a `setall' (if
you're running a SoundBlaster, anyway) to set the instruments.  Finally,
you can then play some of the midi files with `fmplay'.  I recommend
`midifile/example4'.

NOTE!	Most of the programs in this directory are obsolete. At least
	they are not good if they work at all.

	Use the Adagio 0.4 and glib packages by Greg Lee if you
	want working ones.

This directory contains a couple of programs for playing standard 
standard MIDI -files (.MID). This version supports only format 0
(1 tracks). These programs are also capable to play .CMF -files.
If a CMF -file is played, it is first converted to a MIDI -file
(/tmp/cmf_file.mid) which is played. 

Program "midplay" can be used to play MIDI -files with an external
MIDI -synthesizer. It copies NoteOn, NoteOff and ProgramChange
-messages to the midi port.

Program "fmplay" plays a midi file with the FM synthesizer (AdLib).
You have to load the instruments to the kernel before using this program
(see ../README). This version of fmplay is still quite limited. It is suitable
just for verifying that the FM synthesizer works.
"fmp" is an enhanced version of "fmplay". It allows selection between two or 
more synthesizer devices (-d device#).

These programs are based on midifile -package made by
Michael Czeiszperger (czei@pan.com). The original package is included
in the midifile -subdirectory.
