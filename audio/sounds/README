The start of a small library of sound-effects for use in other packages
that would like to clang feep, whistle or burp without each having to supply
its own library of effects.  Feel free to add essentials, but _please_
try not to let it get too huge!  I've provided a small number of "pop culture"
noises just to make it fun, but let's not turn it into a complete library
of beevis-n-butthead quotes or sup folks will mutiny!  Short effects sounds
(tapping, beeping, clicking, etc) rather than long samples are preferred,
and should be descriptively named.  If you've any interesting samples,
please feel free to send them to me!
