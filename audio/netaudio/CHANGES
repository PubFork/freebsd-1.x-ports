Server
	o fixed a bug where the last little bit of audio data would be
	  lost.

	o fixed a bug in readClient where the buffer was being incorrectly
	  padded, possibly resulting in static at the end of the audio data.

	o fixed two track monitor elements.

	o Sun driver

		- fixed a bug that could cause the output to get jumbled.

		- wait for audio to drain after flows finish.

		- Sparc 10 dbri driver.

Library
	o added API for set and get close down mode.

	o added Amiga IFF/8SVX sound file support.

	o close the sound file before the callback is called for
	  AuSoundRecordToFile().

	o make ListBuckets add to the bucket cache.

	o added file format suffixes to the SoundFileInfo structure.

	o added AuSetString() macro.

	o fixed "strdup" bug in SoundCreate.

	o re-arranged some utility routines into separate modules.
	  (NOTE: possible incompatibility - AuMonitorRate and AuMonitorFormat
	         are no longer externed in audioutil.h)

	o add AuWaveFormToString() and AuStringToWaveForm().

	o add AuSoundRecordToData().

	o add stereo support for voc files (thanks to Steven King).

Clients
	o auedit

		- deal with sound files with an unknown number of samples
		  (like those from stdin).

		- add record capability.

	o utilities

		- various new utilities.

	o new auwave sample app.

	o new slider widget for volume/gain controls.

General
	o re-worked the includes of NetAudio.tmpl so it will (hopefully)
	  work on most platforms.

Server
	o Protected malloc/free from audio signals.

	o Fixed setting parameters of waveforms and buckets.

	o New dia/dda interface.

	o Fixed a bug where the flow was re-compiled after
	  an event was requested even if that event didn't change
	  the state of the flow.

	o Fixed possible memory trashing in readClient.

	o Sun driver

		- Don't initialize output gain or internal/external speaker
		  mode.

		- Get rid of some 'clicks'.

		- Deal with the situation when there are no physical outputs
		  in a flow.  This fixes the core dumps when you record before
		  having played anything.

		  gain values.

		- Fixed various bugs in recording (how did it ever work?!)

	o New SGI driver (thanks to Reiner Ernst)
