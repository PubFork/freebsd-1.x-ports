This directory tree contains sources for the Network Audio System, a
network-transparent, client/server audio system, including:

    o	a sample server implementation for /dev/audio on Suns,
	(Tested on SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.2)
    o   a sample server implementation for SGI's Indigo,
	(Tested on IRIX 5.x)
    o	an application programming interface library, and
    o	a variety of sample applications.

The client software can also be used with NCD MCX X terminals running 
NCDware 3.1 or later.

Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

Please note that the Network Audio System has no relationship to the NetAudio 
products from Townshend Computer Tools.

Look at the file doc/slides.ps for a brief presentation on the Network
Audio System.  For more details, read doc/overview.ps.

I.  Roadmap

Here is a quick guide to where things are in this distribution (relative to
the directory netaudio/):

	doc/			not enough documentation; overview, slides, lib
	config/			a little bit of imake stuff
	lib/audio/		API used by sample programs
	clients/audio/		sample programs
	server/			server code
	    dia/		device-independent bits
	    dda/sun/		device-dependent audio driver for Sun /dev/audio
	    dda/sgi/		device-dependent audio driver for SGI Indigo

When built, the server will be in server/ausun or server/ausgi, the library in 
lib/audio/libaudio.a, and the sample applications in clients/audio/aufoo/aufoo.

In addition, the separate distribution sounds.tar.Z contains a directory of
example sounds:

	examples/sounds/	various sounds that can be played

If you don't have your own sound bites to nibble, grab these.

II.  Building the Release

This software uses "imake" and should be usable with the X11R5 configuration
files.  It has been compiled on a Solbourne running SunOS 4.1.3.  Although the
client side should build on other platforms (perhaps with a minimal amount of
hackery), server device drivers are only provided for the Sun.

We hope to put together some notes about how to go write new device-drivers
soon.  Until then, Use The Source, Luke.  It's actually very straightforward;
the /dev/audio port took several days (including debugging the rearchitected
device-independent parts).

To build the software:

    1.	Make sure you have imake from the X11R5 sources.

    2.	Look at config/NetAudio.tmpl and the BINDIR definition if you want;
	by default, the programs are put into /usr/local/bin/.  Some people
	may find it more convenient just to dump them into /usr/bin/X11/.

    3.	Do "xmkmf" create the initial Makefile.

    4.	Do "make World" (note the uppercase World) to build the distribution.

    5.	If everything built successfully, you can install it using
	"make install"; to temporarily stage it under some directory, use
	"make install DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/netaudio" or some such.

    6.	To install the manual pages, use "make install.man" or 
	"make install.man DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/netaudio" as above.


A complete installation should include the following files:

	/usr/include/audio/Afuncproto.h		Header files
	/usr/include/audio/Afuncs.h
	/usr/include/audio/Amd.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aos.h

III.  Using the Network Audio System

Now that you have things built, you can use the Network Audio System
as follows:

	%  # Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your path
	%  ausun -aa &		# -aa allows any host access
	%  setenv AUDIOSERVER `hostname`:0
	%  auinfo
	%  audemo examples/sounds
	%  ...

If you are using it over the network, the shorthand syntax for specifying an
audio server is hostname:0.  Access control is still a bit primitive....



				 *  *  *  *  *

IV.  Using the Network Audio System with Sun Deskset

The "autool" program can be used as a replacement for audiotool.  This
allows Sun Deskset applications (e.g. mailtool, etc.) to be used with
the Network Audio System.  See the autool man page
(clients/audio/autool/autool.man) for details on how to configure
Deskset.



				 *  *  *  *  *

V.  Games

Well, now that you have networked audio, it's time to actually use it
for something.  XBoing and xpilots are both distributed with the
Network Audio System support.  Internally, we have versions of
missileX and a derivative of the old Apple II game spy-vs-spy.  These
aren't included in this distribution due to copyright concerns.



				 *  *  *  *  *

VI.  Finding Sounds to Play With

Users with some versions of SunOS can find a number of audio files to
listen to in /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds/.  Once the Network Audio System
is running, they can be examined using:

	%  audemo /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds

A separate tar archive called sounds.tar.Z is available from ftp.x.org
containing a variety of 22 kHz.  When played on a Sun, the audio data will
automatically be downsampled, which will result in some loss of quality.  For
the best results on a Sun, find some 8 kHz samples.

For the true audio packrat, there are a number of anonymous ftp sites that
contain archives of thousands of sound bites.  The "Sound Site Newsletter"
published periodically on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard, comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc, and
rec.games.misc contains a detailed list of machines, bulletin boards, etc.

VII.  For More Information

We've set up several mailing lists for folks who are working with the
Network Audio System:

    netaudio@ncd.com		General discussion of the Network
				Audio System; anyone who who will
				actively participate is welcome to
				join.

    netaudio-request@ncd.com	Where to send requests to get on or off the
				mailing list.


We hope you enjoy the Network Audio System.  There're still a few
pieces to be added, but already a significant number of hardware and
software vendors are finding that it solves their problems.  Besides,
you can't beat the price!  :-)
