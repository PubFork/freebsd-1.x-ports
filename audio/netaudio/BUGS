Here is a list of the bugs, misfeatures, or significant tasks that we know need
to be taken care of:

    1.	Audio clipping is not handled correctly.  The current
	implementation does something more like wrapping.

    2.	Options for max output gain and the average flows flag need to be
	added to the command line of the sample server.

    3.	Some bogus flows can crash or lock up the server.  More error
	checking needs to be done.

    4.	There are still several unimplemented protocol requests.

    5.	There needs to be a lot more server documentation.

    6.	The "ncdaudio" man page needs to be renamed to "netaudio".

    7.	Another rev of the protocol will be needed to add additional
	synchronization primitives.  Ideally, we'd like hooks for 
	synchronizing audio flows with each other (and with X graphics 
	as well).
