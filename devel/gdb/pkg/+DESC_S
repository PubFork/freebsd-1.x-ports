This the GNU debugger, version 4.11.

It provides better support for C++ and FreeBSD-current's executable
format, though shared lib support, floating point and kernel debugging
are still not in, making it more experimental than anything else.  When
these features have been added, it will replace the current version of 
gdb in FreeBSD 3.5).  Your acceptance of this source package indicates
your willingness to add these features. :-)
