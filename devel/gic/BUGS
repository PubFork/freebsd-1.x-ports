Improvements
------------
Allow and handle multiple selection of files. (may need to update
listbox object to get disjoint multiple selections)

GIC should upgraded to Tcl v7.0 and Tk v3.3 when they are released.

Should be able to change pwd from within gic-start.

Make slow system commands asynchronous.

Add ability to mask files, directories, and status.


Bugs
----
If gic is running twice and one exits, it will kill all the diff and
log boxes displayed by the other.

File names longer than 17 chars are not handled correctly by the
UpdateStatus procedure.
