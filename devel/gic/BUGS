Improvements
------------
Allow and handle multiple selection of files. (may need to update
listbox object to get disjoint multiple selections)

GIC should upgraded to Tcl v7.0 and Tk v3.3 when they are released.

Should be able to change pwd from within gic-start.

Make slow system commands asynchronous.

Add ability to mask files, directories, and status. (eg. Specify only
*.c files or only up-to-date status)

Make already checked out modules red, any modules that need to be
checked out black in gic-start.


Bugs
----
If gic is running twice and one exits, it will kill all the diff and
log boxes displayed by the other.

File names longer than 17 chars are not handled correctly by the
UpdateStatus procedure.

If you take all the lines out of the comment when describing a commit,
then the commit is aborted and gic bombs.
