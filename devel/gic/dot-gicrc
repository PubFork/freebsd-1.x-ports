# If ExpertMode == "No", then confirmation dialog boxes (such as
# the "Are you sure you want to remove..." dialog box) will appear.
# 
set ExpertMode No

# 
# Set the EditorCommand to whatever you want your editor to be.
# Command line parameters are allowed.  If EditorCommand is not set,
# then the environment variable EDITOR is used, otherwise "xterm -e
# vi" is used.  Good examples are:
# 	set EditorCommand "emacs"
# 	set EditorCommand "xterm -e vi"
#
set EditorCommand "emacs"

# 
# The Files list box will never exceed the height specified by
# $MaxFilesListHeight (in lines).  The default is 30.
# 
set MaxFilesListHeight 30

# 
# If ShowDiffOnCommit == Yes, then the diff of a file is displayed
# when it is committed.  This feature doesn't really work very
# well because the commit will pause for a long time if the
# diff has a lock on the file when the commit starts.
# 
set ShowDiffOnCommit Yes
