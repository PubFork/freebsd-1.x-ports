Fri Nov 20 15:39:07 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/default.exp (info set): don't get fooled by the prompt
	in the output.
	(detach): gdb_test can not include $prompt in the expected result.
	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp (backtrace): don't insist on main being
	at level 7; any level is acceptable.

Sun Nov 22 14:44:35 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* lib/remote.exp: Added proc for kermit.

Fri Nov 20 11:23:26 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* config/unix-gdb.exp (gdb_exit):  Add explicit close as
	workaround for expect bug that slowly consumes file descriptors.
	* gdb.t22/virtfunc.exp:  When gdb dumps core, start a new one
	for the benefit of later tests that expect a gdb to be currently
	running.  This is a kludge.
	* configure.in (configdirs):  Add gdb.t16.
	* gdb.t16/{Makefile.in, configure.in, in-gdbme.c, printcmds.exp}:
	New test for exhaustive printing of all ASCII characters and
	substrings, and a few tests for printing of integral values.
	* gdb.t30/chexp.exp:  Add tests for character literals.

Thu Nov 19 17:45:53 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* lib/udi.exp: New procs for udi shells.
	* config/udi-gcc.exp: Made gcc_load
	* config/udi-gdb.exp: Made gdb_start, gdb_load gdb_exit
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: Lots of ugly hacks cause many default
	actions kill the UDI connection. Lookfor for new xfails. Sigh...
	* config/*-gdb.exp: Use which in gdb_version.
	* lib/gcc.exp: Use which in default_gcc_version.
	* runtest.exp: New proc which that does a path lookup.

Wed Nov 18 17:08:08 1992  Michael Werner  (mtw@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Updated c torture tests from the package c-torture-1.7
	  The test in:	    gcc.code_quality
			    gcc.compile
			    gcc.execute
			    gcc.noncompile
			    gcc.unsorted
	  were updated. Existing tests in a given directory that had
	  changed or that were not in 1.7 were moved into a subdirectory
          called "old-tests". 1.7 had a new directory called "special",
          the contents of which were placed in deja-gnu/gcc.special .
	  Also, deleted from a prior Changelog entry was the erroneous
          statement of the removal of support in gcc for the recognition
          of the ".C" extension.

Wed Nov 18 13:36:43 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t30/chexp.exp:  Change print tests to include explicit
	print command so we can also include formats.

Wed Nov 18 12:32:53 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: never change target_os; we need to be able to
	check it in istarget tests.
	* config/unix-gdb.exp (gdb_exit): the string match test was the
	wrong way around; also, call close to try to avoid the file
	descriptor leak in some versions of expect.
	* teststrategy.exp: added some expected failures for Sun4 and
	Solaris, and changed the core dump test to accept a timeout (no
	response from gdb) if a core file was actually created.
	* gdb.t02/whatis.exp, gdb.t03/ptype.exp, gdb.t05/expr.exp,
	gdb.t15/funcargs.exp: added PRMS bug numbers for expected i960
	failures.
	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp (bfddefault): corrected error message.
	(whole file): changed fixme handling to use setup_xfail.

Tue Nov 17 09:14:11 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp (setup_xfail): take optional second argument which
	is the PRMS bug number.
	(pass, fail): use it.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp (accept): gdb 4.7 returns a different
	string.
	(show): don't get fooled by the prompt in the output.
	* gdb.t12/scope.exp: RS/6000 expects to fail print 'file'::var.
	* gdb.t21/cplusfuncs.exp: use setup_xfail rather than FIXME.

Mon Nov 16 12:38:47 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t10/Makefile.in (EXECUTABLES):  Add sparc-elf.
	* gdb.t10/README:  Document sparc-elf.
	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp:  Load and test sparc-elf.
	* gdb.t10/sparc-elf.u:  New test executable.

Mon Nov 16 11:31:30 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* config/unix-tcl.exp: Tcl library init module.
	* tcl.tests: Add the tests directory from the Tcl release.
	* tcl.tests/Makefile.in, configure.in: Support stuff.
	* tcl.tests/tcl-test.exp: Test the Tcl library.

Sun Nov 15 09:30:29 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t30/{Makefile.in, chexp.exp, configure.in}:  New tests
	for GNU-Chill.
	* configure.in (configdirs):  Add gdb.t30.

Fri Nov 13 21:14:13 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp (pass): don't print \n\nXPASS\n\n; just XPASS:
	suffices.
	(setup_xfail): don't set xfail_flag unconditionally; instead set
	it if the argument is the target so that it can be called several
	times.
	(clear_xfail): new function to conditionally clear xfail_flag.
	* config/unix-gdb.exp (gdb_load): set the directory to point to
	whereever the program is loaded from, for the benefit of symbol
	formats which don't know that.
	* teststrategy.exp: accept AIX error messages.
	(print "foo"): AIX shared libraries mean gdb can't find malloc.
	(stack trace): fails on AIX.
	* gdb.t02/in-gdbme.c, gdb.t03/in-gdbme.c: assign to nested_su
	field so that AIX linker doesn't strip it from object file.
	* gdb.t03/ptype.exp (unnamed enumeration): works on RS/6000.
	* gdb.t04/setvar.exp: don't set prms_id to garbage value.
	* gdb.t08/opaque.exp: RS/6000 can't do xrefs.
	* gdb.t09/corefile.exp: AIX gdb can't get name or signal from a
	core file.
	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp: v_signed_char on MIPS generally fails.
	* gdb.t11/list.exp: some tests fail because gcc generates
	incorrect debugging information.
	* gdb.t12/in-gdbme0.c, gdb.t12/in-gdbme1.c: don't let AIX strip
	unreferenced variables.

Thu Nov 12 08:17:40 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp (sum): catch errors from tool_version and tool_exit,
	to ensure that we exit as expected even if they fail.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp, gdb.t00/help.exp: some targets, notably the
	RS/6000, don't support "set write" and "show write".
	* gdb.t11/list.exp (list gdbme0.c:unused, list gdbme1.c:unused):
	mark as expected failures for i960-*-*.  These should perhaps be
	considered successes.

Tue Nov 10 20:40:43 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gcc.exp: Added $LDFLAGS to default_gcc_start so targets can
	get their linker scripts.

Mon Nov  9 10:57:44 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* lib/gcc.exp: new file; defines default_gcc_version and
	default_gcc_start.
	* config/*-gcc.exp: use routines in gcc.exp.
	* gcc.execute/execute.exp: don't use c-torture, because it gives
	us undesired PASS and FAIL reports; use gcc_start instead.
	* gcc.execute/920501-6.c, gcc.execute/920726-1.c: don't include
	<stdio.h> or <strings.h>, so these can be used on VxWorks.
	* gdb.t01/run.exp: expect "run" after sending it to avoid waiting
	for the VxWorks shell too early.

Sun Nov  8 21:38:55 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added subdir_do target, use it for info and install-info

Fri Nov  6 14:10:58 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* config/vx-gdb.exp (gdb_load, spawn_vxgdb): increase timeouts.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: accept AIX error messages, and set the init
	file name based on the target.
	* gdb.t01/run.exp, gdb.t12/scope.exp: increase timeouts for
	VxWorks.
	* gdb.t06/break.exp: increase timeouts for VxWorks, and rewrite a
	few tests to use gdb_test function.

Fri Nov  6 11:34:20 1992  Michael Werner  (mtw@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Moved the following ChangeLog entry from devo/ChangeLog to here:

Wed Nov	 4 17:57:47 1992  Michael Werner  (mtw@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:	Added stuff for building deja-gnu.
	* ./deja-gnu/gdb.t21/ & ./deja-gnu/gdb.t22/:
	Moved in-gdbme.C file to in-gdbme.cc to enhance portability.
	Changed the configure.in file to reflect the filename extension
        change.

Fri Nov  6 14:00:48 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumbest.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t15/funcargs.exp: continue to call6k is an expected failure
	for i960-*-vxworks; PRMS 1786.

Thu Nov  5 18:09:23 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* lib/prebase.exp: Remove incorrect fix.  CPLUSFLAGS needs to be
	reset on a per test case basis, as it is changed by each test
	case.  The correct way to fix this is to establish a default value
	for the variable, and set the variable to that value.

Thu Nov  5 18:04:21 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp: proc unknown doesn't print the error codes if
	they're aren't any.
	* lib/remote.exp: New procs tip and tip_download for boards that
	live on the end of a serial cable.
	* config/abug-gcc.exp: Init module for MVME board.
	* config/mt-m68k-abug: Makefile frag for m68k MVME board.
	* configure.in: Only makes links for config files that exist.

Thu Nov  5 17:40:27 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* {gdb.t20, gdb.t21, gdb.t22}/{Makefile.in, configure.in}:
	Convert C++ filenames from '.C' to '.cc'.  Rename test files.

Wed Nov  4 11:50:34 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumbest.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gdb.exp (gdb_test): don't check specially for attach error,
	since that doesn't belong in a general test.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: fix attach and run tests for VxWorks.
	* gdb.t04/setvar.exp: clean up a few broken tests, eliminating
	some false failures incorrectly marked FIXME.
	* gdb.t12/scope.exp: do two ``next'' commands if necessary to skip
	over the call to init.
	* gdb.t20/classes.exp, gdb.t20/inherit.exp: make FIXME cases use
	setup_xfail.

Tue Nov  3 11:53:37 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumbest.cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp (clone_output): send strings to the user even if
	they say FIXME.
	* gdb.t01/in-gdbme.c (vxmain): new function for VxWorks which
	takes an argument and calls main with it.
	gdb.t01/run.exp: for *-*-vxworks, call vxmain to pass arguments,
	and look for results from connected task, not gdb.
	* gdb.t01/term.exp: don't run these tests unless native.
	* gdb.t02/whatis.exp, gdb.t03/ptype.exp, gdb.t05/expr.exp: expect
	the i960 to fail to print type char correctly, because gdb treats
	char as unsigned char.
	* gdb.t06/in-gdbme.c (vxmain): new function for VxWorks which
	takes an argument and calls main with it.
	gdb.t06/break.exp: adjust line numbers for previous change.  For
	target *-*-vxworks, call vxmain to pass arguments.
	* gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp: don't check the first old value after
	restarting the program, because on VxWorks it will not have been
	reset.
	* gdb.t08/opaque.exp: don't check the breakpoint number, because
	on VxWorks gdb_load stops and restarts gdb.
	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp: don't run these tests for i960 targets,
	because bfd uses SELECT_VECS and these formats are unknown.
	* gdb.t11/list.exp: changed some FIXME strings to use setup_xfail.

Mon Nov  2 19:00:36 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumbest.cygnus.com)

	* config/vx-gdb.exp: use the new generic communication routines in
	lib/remote.exp.
	lib/remote.exp (rlogin): if we get "Sorry, this system is
	engaged", try again; it can come from VxWorks just after
	rebooting.

Sat Oct 31 20:11:12 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp: procs pass & fail now use a flag set by setup_xfail
	to determine it a test is an expected failure or an unexpected
	success.
	* runtest.exp: New proc setup_xfail. If called with a configure
	pattern it sets up the next test as an expected failure or an
	unexpected success.

Sat Oct 31 16:10:14 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp: Entire file re-written to use the new
	gdb_test command.

Sat Oct 31 12:12:08 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gdb.exp: gdb_test now traps cleanly if send fails cause gdb
	core dumped.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: Rewrote the first few tests to use the
	gdb_test proc.
	* lib/gdb.exp: Added a gdb_test proc. It takes a command and a
	pattern and runs the gdb test.

Fri Oct 30 11:46:45 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

        * runtest.exp:  Guard against nonexistant PWD environment var,
        which is shell dependent.

Fri Oct 30 20:23:06 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp: Changed format of log messages. $prms_id & $bug_id
	are only printed if they are not 0. Also they now appear at the
	end of the line in parens with a label.
	* runtest.exp: New procs xpass & xfail for expected failures and
	unexpected successes. Added successes to proc sum.
	* runtest.exp: istarget & ishost with no arguments returns the
	target and host triplet strings.
	* runtest.exp: New proc isnative. Returns a 1 if running native,
	a 0 if on a target.
	* config/nind-gcc.exp, coff-gcc.ecp, aout-gcc.exp: Applied patch
	from vx-gcc.exp so errror messages don't always go to the screen.

Thu Oct 29 19:07:28 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* Changed all refences to $srcdir/lib to ./lib since configure now
	makes a link for it.
	* config/vx-gcc.exp: gcc_load doesn't try to load a program if
	there is no remote shell.
	* lib/remote.exp: The network procs telnet, rlogin, rsh now do
	three retries before exiting with an error.
	* runtest.exp: Fixed so there are multiple ways to get the users
	login name so it can be printed in the logs.
	* doc/DejaGnu.l, dejagnu.texi: Removed references to $nfshost.
	* runtest.exp: Removed the --nfshost option cause it's become
        unnessary.
	* configure.in: Deals with the shorter names in config. Creates an
	 abbreviation for the OS and uses that for the filename substring. 
	* config/*: All names shortened to <= 14 characters.
	All init-$target_os-$tool.exp changed to $target_os-$tool.exp. 
        * config/mt-vxworks68, mt-vxworks960: Changed to use the
        abbreviated triplet form like all the other stubs. Now mt-m68k-vx
        and mt-i960-vx. 

Tue Oct 27 10:27:33 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp: When setting base_dir don't use getenv("PWD") until
	the code works when there is no PWD env variable.

Tue Oct 27 07:37:38 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/default.exp: accept "can't create process" error for run
	on VxWorks.
	gdb.t08/opaque.exp: don't look for $binfile when setting
	breakpoint.
	gdb.t15/funcargs.exp: added -re "$prompt $" cases.
	gdb.t20/classes.exp: accept \t as well as space after line number.
	gdb.t22/virtfunc.exp: added expected failure for "cannot invoke
	functions on this machine".
	lib/gdb.exp (runto): added -re "$prompt $" cases.

	* lib/gdb.exp: renamed from break.exp.  Moved gdb_unload and runto
	in from config/init-unix-gdb.exp.
	config/init-unix-gdb.exp: removed gdb_unload and runto.
	config/init-vxworks-gdb.exp: removed runto.
	(gdb_start): added "set args main" so that "run" with no arguments
	works as on Unix.
	config/*-gdb.exp: include gdb.exp, not break.exp.

	* gdb.t01/in-gdbme.c: supply static atoi for vxworks, return
	rather than calling exit (avoids VxWorks vs. libgcc problem).
	gdb.t07/in-gdbme.c: return rather than calling exit.
	gdb.t08/in-gdbme0.c: return rather than calling exit.
	gdb.t13/in-gdbme.c: return rather than calling exit.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: don't set height and width here.
	config/init-unix-gdb.exp (gdb_start): set it here.
	config/init-vxworks-gdb.exp (gdb_start): and here.
	* config/init-vxworks-gdb.exp (runto): new function, similar to
	init-unix-gdb.exp function.

Mon Oct 26 09:16:24 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t12/scope.exp: check for $prompt when failing, not just
	timeout.
	* gdb.t11/list.exp: accept tab as well as space after line number.
	* gdb.t09/corefile.exp: don't run these tests on a target system.
	gdb.t09/Makefile.in: don't complain if can not dump core.
	* lib/break.exp: new file, for delete_breakpoints function.
	config/*-gdb.exp: include it.
	* config/init-vxworks-gdb.exp (gdb_start): open the telnet
	connection in gdb_start, not just once.
	(telnet_init): If shell is locked, retry.
	(gdb_load): check for $prompt; also stop and restart gdb before
	loading each file, because vxgdb accumulates symbols and lets the
	old ones take precendence.

Sun Oct 25 11:35:49 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* config/init-vxworks-gcc.exp: Now works good, traps load errors
	cleanly. 
	* runtest.exp, doc/dejagnu.texi: Changed all occurences of
	$defaultmode to $connectmode.
	* config/init-vxworks-gcc.exp, init-unix-gcc.exp: Fixed so
	compiler output doesn't go to the screen unless $verbose>1.
	* runtest.exp: Improved error handling in proc unknown by having
	it dump state.

Sun Oct 25 11:35:49 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* runtest.exp, doc/dejagnu.texi: Changed all occurences of

	compiler output doesn't go to the screen unless $verbose>1.
	* runtest.exp: Improved error handling in proc unknown by having
	it dump state.

Sat Oct 24 22:44:09 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* gcc.execute/execute.exp: Looks at $status after executing the
	test code.
	* config/init-unix-gcc.exp: Made gcc_load work and set $status.
	* runtest.exp: Moved regex variables for decimal and hex from
	init-unix-gdb.exp. 

Fri Oct 23 12:03:47 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* config/mt-m68k-aout, mt-m68k-coff, mt-i960-nindy, mt-a29k-udi:
	New makefile stubs.
        * config/init-nindy-gdb.exp, init-nindy-gdb.exp, init-nindy-gdb.exp:
	New init modules for nindy tests.
	* configure.in: Added aout, coff, udi targets.
        * config/init-aout-gdb.exp, init-coff-gdb.exp, init-udi-gdb.exp:
	New init modules for gdb tests.
        * config/init-aout-gcc.exp, init-coff-gcc.exp, init-udi-gcc.exp:

Fri Oct 23 11:56:02 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/in-gdbme.c: added definition of atoi when using VxWorks.
	gdb.t06/break.exp: adjusted line numbers for above change.

Thu Oct 22 21:39:03 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Added to site target so the value of LIBS goes into
	site.exp.

Thu Oct 22 12:16:03 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/help.exp: VxWorks support:
	help i, help info: info sharedlibrary line is optional
	help source: accept .vxgdbinit as well as .gdbinit
	* gdb.t00/default.exp: VxWorks support:
	add-symbol-file, show prompt: use $prompt, not (gdb)
	i, info: info sharedlibrary line is optional
	load, r, run, x: accept vxgdb responses as legitimate
	* config/init-vxworks-gdb: send a single \n at end, because
	otherwise the multiple prompts confuse the expect scripts.

Wed Oct 21 16:06:33 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: use new variable $(LIBS) when
	linking.
	config/mt-vxworks68, config/mt-vxworks960: define LIBS as -lgcc.
	* configure.in: add irix* to list of unix targets.

Tue Oct 20 12:31:38 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (subdirs): Fixed so that make works, even when whole
	subdirectories of tests are removed.  This way, subsets of the
	whole set of test can be distributed.

Mon Oct 19 10:59:19 1992  Rob Savoye  (rob at darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* gcc.execute/execute.exp: Runs all the test from the c-torture test's
	execute directory.
        * gcc.execute: New directory
	* gcc.code_quality/code_quality.exp: Runs all the test from the c-torture test's
	code_quality directory.
