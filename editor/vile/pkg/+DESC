VILE -- VI Like Emacs: a vi workalike put together from Micro-Emacs by Paul Fox
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        This editor grew out of a frustration that although lots of
        eager programmers have tackled rewrites of Emacs, with new and
        better features (not to mention free source), I've not seen
        anything similar done with the Second True Editor.  (The
        First, of course, being /bin/ed)
