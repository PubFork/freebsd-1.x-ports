		THE POINT TEXT EDITOR FOR X

Point is a text editor for X windows.  It is specifically designed to use
the mouse as much as possible in editing.  It also provided convenient
ways to keep a number of windows open on files and ways to copy text
between and within files using the mouse.

Some features of Point:
* Unlimited number of windows and files
* Easy move and copy within and between windows
* Completely configurable: menus, key meanings, titles, etc.
* Extensive options to modify the look and behavior
* Uses Tcl as a macro language and the Tk toolkit
* Flexible searching: for selection, for last string searched for,
    for a regular expression, for the last regular expression,
    for a string in a list of files, for a C tag.
* File browsers vaguely similar to NeXT to load files.
* Circular mouse menus, that is, "gesture" commands
* Unlimited undo, redo and again (repeat last command)
