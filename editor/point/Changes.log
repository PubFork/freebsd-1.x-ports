	Changes to Point

------------------------------- Version 1.1 --------------------------------

7 feb 92 -- (New version) Version 1.1 of Point which is compatible with the
	Tk1.4 toolkit and Tcl 6.2.

13 feb 92 -- (Bug fix) compile bug in tkColbox.c fixed.  Wrong number of
	arguments.

18 feb 92 -- (Change) add regular expression seach and regular expression
	  replace. The form of the regular expression is the same as in grep/ed
          (not full regular expressions as in egrep).  The replace is the
          same as in the 's' command in ed, ex, sed and vi. Added commands:
          * RegexSearch -- search for a regular expression
          * RepeatRegexSearch -- search for the last RE entered
          * RegexReplaceOne -- replace the last string found in an RE search
          * RegexReplaceAll -- do a complete RE replace operation.

18 feb 92 -- (Change) rearranged the order in most of the menus.

20 feb 92 -- (New version) Version 1.2 of Point with regular expressions.

------------------------------- Version 1.2 --------------------------------

21 feb 92 -- (Bug fix) corrected some problems with cursor motion from keys,
	that is, the MoveSel cluster of operations.  They seem to work now
	in that they don't mess up the display.  Also cursor right and cursor
	left now move the next or previous line as expected.

23 feb 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed a problem where Point would fail on partial
	geometries, that is, ones with the +N+N at the end
	(only the dimensions).

28 feb 92 -- (Change) changed tkerror so that it doesn't print anything.
	I was getting too many spurious errors caused by Tk menu problems.

3 mar 92 -- (Change) Sel get now returns the line number of the first
	character of the selection as an argument: firstChar lastChar
	windowName selectionMode lineNumberOfFirstChar.

3 mar 92 -- (Change) selecting in line mode (triple clicking) now displays
	the line numer of the first character of the selection in the browser
	message area.

3 mar 92 -- (Change) changed FILE menu, 'Close' --> 'Close window' and added a
	'Quit Point =>'	menu.

4 mar 92 -- (Bug fix) when the browser was showing file sizes the names
	were not gotten correctly and you could not open and files or CD.
	Also directories were not sorted first when file sizes were
	showing.

4 mar 92 -- (Change) added option 'insertReplaces'.  The default is False.
	When it is set to True, then a selection of more than one character
	will be deleted when characters are typed.  This makes the insert like
	the Macintosh for selection larger than one character.  This
	facility is a compromise.  It does not replace for selections
	of only one character because Point does not allow zero width
	selections.

5 mar 92 -- (Change) changed pt to open windows at location1, location2 or
	location3. location1 is the default.  pt takes arguments of the form
	-1, -2 and -3 that affect all subsequent windows until changed.  E.g.:
		pt -2 file1 -1 *.c -3 file2

5 mar 92 -- (Change) removed 'lineNumbers' option.  Instead line numbering is
	done on a window by window basis.  There is a new command
	'SetLineNumbers'. 	The first argument is the window to be
	affected ("" means the current window.  The second argument can
	be "0" to turn off line numbering and "1" to turn it on.
	Anything else	toggles the it.

5 mar 92 -- (Bug fix) in pt where it used the cwd of point rather than
	of pt.  Also changed the default to not wait for the windows
	to close.  Thus the -nw and -nowait options are eliminated and
	replaced by option -w and -wait.

5 mar 92 -- (mew version) Version 1.3 of Point with the above changes and fixes.

------------------------------- Version 1.3 --------------------------------

13 mar 92 -- (Change) changed messageFlags to allow messages to go in message
	lines in browsers and in text windows.  To accomodate the fact that
	browsers are narrow now and that some people don't use the
	browsers and still want to see messages.  I put a message line
	under the menu bar in text windows.  I like it even if it does
	use up a line.

24 mar 92 -- (Note)  If you do not want windows to be
	automatically placed but would rather have the window manager ask
	you where to place each window it is necessary to comment out the
	lines: wm positionfrom $name user in putsetup.tcl lines 24 (for
	browser windows) and line 118 (for text windows).  It is also
	necessary to specify only partial geometries (height and width but
	not x and y) in the geometry specifications.  For example, change
	502x410+0+0 to 502x410.

26 mar 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed the error messages in browser.c change directory.

6 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) The Keyword Search box was not acting correctly.
	It would not search for the correct string when you clicked on
	a file name. Also it would keep adding '*'s if you clicked
	multiple times on a file name and it would not find the file
	if there was already a '*' in front of it.
	These bugs are all corrected.

9 apr 92 -- (Change) added a file "options.tcl" that contains the default
	values of all Point options.  This can be used as a guide to show
	you how to set each option, to tell you what all the options are
	and to show you the default for each option.

9 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) found the performance problem with saves.  I was
	writing a progress message to each window each time I filled a buffer.
	This was taking about 130 milliseconds!

9 apr 92 -- (Change) added options to allow the browser window and icon
	title to be set by the user.  Now there are four options:
	* browserIconFormat and browserTitleFormat -- these are printf-like
	    strings but the only special format recognized is "%d" which
	    is the name of the directory in the browser
	* textIconFormat and textTitleFormat -- these are printf-like
	    strings with the options as follows:

	%n -- the file name (affected by pathNames option)
	%N -- the full path name of the file
	%s -- the short file name
	%c/modMsg/ -- "modMsg" if the file has changed and "" otherwise.
		The matching '/'s can be any character.
	%r/readOnlyMsg/ -- "readOnlyMsg" if file is read only
		and "" otherwise.  The matching '/'s can be any character.
	%o/overtypeMsg/ -- "overtypeMsg" if Point is in overType mode
		and "" otherwise.  The matching '/'s can be any character.
	%l -- the line number of the top line in the window
	%L -- the line number of the bottom line in the window
	%p -- the character number of the first character in the window
	%P -- the character number of the last character in the window
	%S -- the size of the file in characters
	%v -- the column number of the leftmost column in the window
	%V -- the column number of the rightmost column in the window

9 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a bug that caused Point to go into an infinite
	loop when you backspaced (erasing characters) from the second line of
	the file to the first line of the file.

9 apr 92 --(Bug fix)  Fixed a bug where "Close and ask" would ask whether
	to save a file but then not really save if even if you answered yes.

9 apr 92 -- (bugfix) when you are no the bottom line of the window and insert
	a CR the window did not scroll.  I fixed this and also made it so
	the auto scrolling occurs only in this case, not when you just
	get to the bottom line of the display as it used to do.

9 apr 92 -- (Change) added tcl code to make it easy to move the scroll bar
	to the right.  See window.tcl/TextWindow2.

9 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed various bugs relating to the EOF marker and
	incorrect displays resulting from doing things at the EOF marker.

9 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed Enter Ascii which wasn't working at all.

10 apr 92 -- (Change) User formatted backup file names were not working.
	The reason was that the %n specification was replaced by the FULL
	pathname of the file rather than the last component.  I have added
	a %N specification which is replaced by the last component of the
	filename and a %D specification which is replaced by the full
	pathname of the directory the file resides in.  So if you have
	a general backups directory "backups" in your login directory
	you can specify a backup file name with:
		Option set backupNameFormat "~/backups/%N.%v"
	and the directory the original file it is in is not used.
	If you want backups to go into a  backups directory in the
	same directory as the filed being backed up use:
		Option set backupNameFormat "%D/backups/%N.%v"
	Finally if you want the backups to be in the same directory
	as the original file (that is, the file being backed up) use:
		Option set backupNameFormat "%n.%v"
	or
		Option set backupNameFormat "%D/%N.%v"
	It will always be true that %D/%N=%n.

10 apr 92 -- (Change) Added code to allow the browser listboxes to use the same
	"line to top" scrolling that the text windows use.  It will
	be controlled by the "tkScrolling" option.

10 apr 92 -- (Change) Added a line in subs.tcl/bin.entry.  Now if you click the
	middle mouse button in an extry field it will insert the current
	X (or Point) selection at the insertion point of the text
	entry field.  This should be handy for coping in search strings
	and keyword search strings.

13 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed "Find Matching Bracket" which was one off before.

15 apr 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a bug when selecting a file to open when
	the file sizes are displayed.  The problem was that a string
	was being reused too early.

17 apr 92 -- (New version) Release vesion 1.4.

------------------------------- Version 1.4 --------------------------------

26 may 92 -- (Change) made changes so Point works with Tk2.1 (and Tk2.0)
	and Tcl6.3.

26 may 92 -- (Change) default "location"s set for a 1280x1024 size screen.
	(It used to be for a 1152x900 screen.)

26 may 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed a bug the caused the "Move Window" commands not to
	place windows correctly.

26 may 92 -- (Change) Added a facilty to save the current option setting to a
	file.  The tcl proc MakeSaveOptionsBox will ask for a file name (the
	default is "options.tcl") and write out the current values of all
	the options.  The startup sequence automatically reads "options.tcl".
	The command to bring up the save options box has been put in the
	browser menu "MENU/MISC/Save Point Options".

26 may 92 -- (Change) The startup sequence has been changed a little.
	A new file "sourcing.tcl" reads in all the necessary tcl code.
	The file "options.tcl" is now read to set all the Point options.

28 may 92 -- (Change) changed the name of doc/point.n to doc/point.man

28 may 92 -- (Change) added an autosave feature.  Just a tcl procedure in
	subs.tcl. Execute the command "AutoSave on 600" to begin automatic
	saving at intervals of 10 minutes (600 = 10 * 60 seconds).
	The command "AutoSave off" turns off automatic saves.  After each
	interval, all files that have been changed but not saved are saved.

28 may 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed a bug where the line number got off by 1
	whenever a search wrapped around to the beginning of the file.

28 may 92 -- (Change) added code to make Point read the X resource database
	for the values of Point options.  This is done before ptsetup.tcl
	is read so any options setting from tcl will override the X resource
	database option values.

29 may 92 -- (Change) added a new box to rebind the meanings of keystrokes for
	existing windows.  The box has a scrolling list of command names
	(with some comments on arguments), an entry box for (fixed)
	arguments to the command, a scrolling list of key names and
	a button to rebind the key.  This will NOT affect new windows
	created after the rebind but will affect all existing windows.
	(in tclLib/cmd.tcl).

29 may 92 -- (Change) added the ability to change menus on the fly.  The two
	relevant tcl procs are RemakeTextMenus and RemakeBrowserMenus.
	These procs will destroy the old menu and create a new menu
	according to TextMenuSpec, BrowserMenuSpec or ThinBrowserMenuSpec.
	To change a text menu you first change TextMenuSpec (be sure to
	declare it global) and then call RemakeTextMenus.
	
29 may 92 -- (Change) added code to windows.tcl to poll for when a window is
	mapped.  Mold this into a facility that changes the mouse
	cursor until the window is mapped.

18 june 92 -- (New version) Released version 1.5 for beta test.


------------------------------- Version 1.5 --------------------------------

18 june 92 -- (Bug fix) Some of the default Tk Button bindings did not seem to
	always work.  The fix is to redo them myself in ptsetup.tcl.

18 june 92 -- (Bug fix) Error in startup.tcl so it only works
	if there is a .ptrc.

19 june 92 -- (Change) eliminated my versions of tkMenu.c and tlColbox.c.
	It is too error prone to maintain my own versions.

19 jun2 92 --  (New version) Released version 1.51.


------------------------------- Version 1.51 --------------------------------

24 june 92 -- (Bug fix) button1ScrollsDown was not working for browsers.
	Fixed that with a change to tclLib/windows.tcl/proc PtScroll.

25 june 92 -- (Change) help/*.help files made read only.

25 june 92 -- (Bug fix) when the ChangeCaseOfSel command was executed
	in a read only file Point when into an infinite loop.

6 july 92 -- (Change) Added the ability to change the size of the open window
	list in a thin browser window.  If you click Control-Button3 inside the
	open window list, the list gets one line larger.  Clicking
	Control-Button1 makes the open window list one line shorter.

8 july 92 -- (Change) changed pt.c to prevent it from trying to start a new
	version of Point when it times out.  Now it tries only once.
	I added an option to the OpenWindow command to tell it to automatically
	create a file that does not exists.  This solves the timeout
	problem with pt because it was putting up a dialog box and
	waiting for the user to respond.  It was difficult to do this
	within the timeout period.  But when the file is created
	without asking then there are no timeout problems.

8 july 92 -- (Change) added a third parameter to OpenWindow.  If the third
	parameter is "doNotAsk" then Point will create a file that
	does not exist without asking the user for confirmation.
	If there is no third parameter or it is not "doNotAsk"
	then the usual behavior is in effect: if a file does not
	exist, ask before creating it.

29 july 92 -- (note) "Find whole words" only works with fixed text searching
	NOT with regular expression searching.

30 july 92 -- (Change) Added two related functions.  The first is the ability
	to run a program as a subprocess and connect to it with a pty (pseudo-
	teletype).  When you enter this mode in a window two tings happen:
	(1) all input to the window is sent to the subprocess rather than
	being inserted into the file in the window and
	(2) all output from the subprocess is inserted into the file in the
	window.  Here are some examples of how this might be used:
	(A) run the command "ls" in the window to insert an ls listing
	into the file.  The program needs no input so it just runs and
	its output is inserted into the window.  You could also do this
	with other program that require no interactions such as: cat
	(to insert a file), date, pwd, etc.
	(B) You could run a shell in the window to allow the use of shells
	in Point.
	
	If the subprocess goes into full screen mode (typically through
	"curses") such as elm, vi, etc. then Point goes into a special
	full screen mode where a screen buffer is allocated and the window
	is temporarily disconnected from its file.  All output from the
	subprocess is put into the screen buffer.  This allows the use
	of such programs in a Point window.  When the subprocess exits
	from full screen mode the screen buffer is discarded and the
	window is reconnected to the file.

31 july 92 -- (Change) Changed to order of the bindings in tclLib/textMenu.tcl
	so that the binding for <Left> comes after the bindings for 
	<Shift-Left> and <Control-Left>.  Otherwise the binding for
	<None-Left> is wrong.  Ditto for <Right>.

31 july 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed moving cursor up and down so it remembers the
	column you started on as you move up and down among lines of different
	lengths.

31 july 92 -- (Change) changed multiple clicking to the X/Tk standard, that is,
	double and triple click must be within the X defined double
	click period.

3 aug 92 -- (Change) Changed the keyword search box to include a text entry
	field to specify the files to search in (default is *).  Thanks to
	Bruno Serra for these changes.

3 aug 92 -- (Change) Added tcl macros to delete to the end of a line
	(DeleteLine) and to delete an entire line (DeleteLine 1).  Thanks to
	Bruno Serra for these changes.

3 aug 92 -- (Change) removed <Shift-Left> and <Shift-Right> bindings in 
	tclLib/textMenu.tcl because 'Shift" is ignored in key bindings
	because each key already implies a shift state.  Now <Control-Left>
	and <Mod1-Left> move a word left (ditto for Right).  Note that
	"Mod1" is X/tk-talk for the Alt or Meta key.

3 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a keyboard focus problem.  When you click inside a
	one-line text entry field (like the message line at the top
	of windows or the entry lines in dialog boxes) the keyboard focus
	goes to that entry field and stays there even if the mouse moves
	outside it.  Then it was impossible to enter text in the text
	window unless you closed the window containing the entry field
	that had the focus.  You can tell this happened because you can
	see the thick black vertical bar cursor in the entry field.
	Note: it is not necessary to click inside an entry field to
	type into it.  Just move the mouse inside the field and start
	typing.
	Fix: Now if you click with the left mosue button inside any text
	window the keyboard focus is removed from any other window.

7 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) MoveSel word right at EOF caused Point to hang.

10 aug 92 -- (Change) removed the concept of s "thin browser".
	Now all browsers are the "thin" one-column variety.

10 aug 92 -- (Change) added the ability to change more string valued
	options to the PREFS menu.

11 aug 92 -- (Change) added the ability to mark the active window and
	the active browser.  Many commands apply to the active window and the
	active browser determines the current directory in Point so it
	is improtant to know what they are.  The mechanism is a format
	conversion in the title and icon format strings.  I have added
	a "%a" format to: textTitleFormat, textIconFormat,
	browserTitleFormat and browserIconFormat.  It is of the form:
		"%a.text."
	If the window or browser is active then the string "text"
	is inserted into the window title or icon name.  The default
	textTitleFormat is now:
		%a.@.%n%r. readOnly. [%l-%L] %c. (modified).
	which puts an "@" in front of the name of the active window.
	The default browserTitleFormat is:
		%a.CD:.%d
	which puts a "CD:" in front of the directory name if the
	active browser.

11 aug 92 -- (Change) Updated the reference manual and manual page.
	They should both be up to date with all the changes up to this point.

12 aug 92 -- (New version) Released version 1.53.
	

-------------------12 August 1992-----Version 1.53------------------------

14 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) fixed a bug that caused Point to crash when a window came
	up over a tearoff menu. (change to display.c/SetWindowTitle.

14 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) a bug that caused an infinite loop when doing a
	search and replace.  The problem was when "wrapAroundSearches"
	was set.  The search in the loop kept wrapping around.  The
	fix is to turn off "wrapAroundSearches" for the duration of the
	replace command.

18 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a bug in the indent macto (in tclLib/macros.tcl)
	that caused outdenting to go into an infinite loop.  Also changed
	output so it acts more sensibly, that is, it does nothing on lines
	that do not begin with a tab or a space.

18 aug 92 -- (Change) made a change to shellWindow.c to prevent a segmentation
	fault when it can't find the "TERMCAP" environment variable.

20 aug 92 -- (Bug fix) Go to line number did not set the selection window
	so if you went to a line number and it was not in the selection window
	the selection was not set correctly.

25 aug 92 -- (Change) Using control-mouse clicks to change the size of the
	open window list seemed awkward so I eliminated that.  Instead I
	added arrow buttons below the open window list that change the
	number of open window names displayed.

25 aug 92 --(Bug fix) fixed a bug where the watch cursor remained if you
	cancelled closing a window.

25 aug 92 --(Bug fix) fixed a bug that caused Point to quit even though
	you cancelled the closing of a window.

11 sept 92 -- (Change) removed "noBrowser" from the list of saved options
	since it causes the -nobrowser option to be ignored.

11 sept 92 -- (Change) changed search and replace so that it prints a message
	indicating how maybe replacements were made

11 sept 92 -- (Change) added a new command that displays its first argument
	on the Point message lines (at the top of text windows).  The command
	is called "MessageLine" and takes one argument.

11 sept 92 -- (New version) Released version 1.55.


-------------------11 September 1992-----Version 1.55------------------------

15 sept 92 -- (Bug fix) added stdio.h to library.c to define stderr.

15 sept 92 -- (Bug fix) added up.bm and down.bm to the list of files to include
	in the distribution.

23 sept 92 -- (Change) changed the commands on the browser menu
	"MENU/SHELL-PTY/Run csh in window" and MENU/SHELL-PTY/Run csh in file"
	to use the user "SHELL" environment variable instead of the csh.  The
	menu labels have been changed accordingly.

23 sept 92 -- (Change) some include files, externs and Imakefile
	changes for better portability.

30 sept 92 -- (Bug fix) that prevented the last character of the file from
	being displayed when you were typing in text.

30 sept 92 -- (New version) Released version 1.56.


-------------------30 September 1992-----Version 1.56------------------------

4 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a bug introduced earlier in fixing another
	bug.  When you backspaced to the first column the cursor would
	disappear.  Fixed.

18 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Eliminated a tk "Cannot find window" message.
	NOTE: All 18 dec 92 changes are from Pascal Meheut. Thanks Pascal!

18 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a bug in how the up and down arrow keys work
	in terms of staying in the same column.

18 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Detect case when the fonts cannot be found.

18 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixed a problem with screen update when scrolling.

18 dec 92 -- (Change) Changed the wording on the "*" option in Browser menu.

18 dec 92 -- (Bug fix) Fixgeometry was messing up some valid geometries.

6 jan 93 -- (Version fix) Make changes to allow point to work with Tk3.0
	and tcl 6.5.  The only real change was to change all window
	names that began with upper case letters since tk3.0 does not
	allow this.

13 jan 93 -- (Change) Added an option "keepSelectionVisible" that moves
	the selection as you scroll up and down in a window in order to
	keep the selection visible in the window.  Having this option on
	prevents you from making a selection larger than the size of the
	window.

13 jan 93 -- (Bug fix) changed TCL_FILES in the Imakefile so that it will
	not fail on installation.

13 jan 93 -- (New version) Released version 1.57.


------------------13 jan 1993------- Version 1.57 ---------------------------

20 jan 93 -- combined point and pt into one program.  With all the toolkit
	stuff pt was nearly as big as point.  If called with name "pt"
	it acts like pt otherwise it acts like point.

20 jan 93 -- fix more tk3.0 related problems.  I missed a number of window
	names that began with an upper letter.  I think I have them all now.

20 jan 93 -- (New version) Released version 1.58.


------------------20 jan 1993------- Version 1.58 ---------------------------

22 jan 93 -- (Bug fix) There were two calls to createWindow in Point.c
	(lines 285 and 289).  I removed the second one.  How did they
	get there?

25 jan 93 -- (Imakefile bug) Removed the stuff about pt from the Imakefile.

11 feb 93 -- (Bug fix) Fixed how the focus works to allow for the focus
	changes in tk3.0

25 feb 93 -- (Bug fix) filePatterm was not working at all except
	for filePatterm="*".  The fix was to turn off ignoreCase
	while searching for file patterns.  This is correct since
	case matters in file names.  The real bug is that the re_exec
	(regular expression matching) is incorrect when case is
	ignored.  This has been fixed also.

26 feb 93 -- (Note) TIOCNOTTY (shellWindow.c line 755) is not found on some
	systems (HPUX in particular).  You can just comment out this line if
	it causes trouble.

3 march 93 -- (Bug) In "SaveAs", if you try to write an existing file, Point
	would ask for permission to overwrite and if given the file name
	written to would be "y".  Fixed.

3 march 93 -- (Change) The entry widgets in all popup dialog boxes no longer
	export the X selection.  The entry widget that is the message line
	in each window still does, as does any Point selection.  I felt that
	one would not expect or want the kind of strings you enter into
	text boxes to become the X selection.  This was done by added the
	option "-exportselection no" to each :entry" widget.  These can
	be removed to return to the old behavior of exporting the X
	selection from these entry widgets.

3 march 93 -- (Bug) In the tcl code for IndentSelection (in macros.tcl) the
	loop did not check to see if it was at the end of the file and, if
	it was, would loop forever effectively crashing Point.  This has
	been fixed with an explicit check to see if we are at the end of
	the file.

3 march 93 -- (Bug) The cursor disappeared when you backspaced over the
	last character of the file.  Fixed.

19 march 93 -- (Bug) The reappearing bug of the first character of the
	line not be repainted reappeared again.  The problem was a
	"dangling else" problem.  I had an "if" in copymove.c where I
	added an "elseless-if" to the "then" part and it captured the "else".
	Brackets around the "then" part fixed the bug.

22 march 93 -- (Bug) When a file was changed and closed Point did not set the
	owner and permissions to that of the old file.  Now it does.  The
	new version of the file is a rewritten version so it has a different
	inode number and so hard links will be broken.  But the owner and
	permissions will be set for the new file exactly as they are set
	for the old file.

24 match 93 -- (Bug) The fix of 3march93 caused another bug.  Fixed that.

24 march 93 -- (Change in semantics) The "Move to end of file" command was
	changing the selection to the end of the file.  I changed it so
	it does not affect the selection.  I'm not sure why I ever had
	it changing the selection.

31 march 93 -- (New options) Point does not conform to X window conventions
	about the selection, in particular, when it loses the X selection
	Point does not visually deselect the selected text.  I am adding
	two options to allow the user to choose that (or a related) behavior.
	The two new options are:
		deSelectedTextForeground
		deSelectedTexBackground
	Whenever Point loses the X selection, the selection is redrawn in
	these colors.  When Point regains the X selection, the selection
	is redrawn in the (selectedTextForeground,selectedTexBackground)
	colors.
	
	To get typical X window behavior you make the deselected text
	colors the same as the normal text colors.  When Point loses
	the selection it will, in effect, disappear.  (Although it will
	still be selected from Point's viewpoint.)
	
	To get the behavior Point had before, make the delected text
	colors the same as the selected text colors.
	
	To get a new type of behavior make the deselected text colors
	different from either the selected or normal text colors.  One
	idea is to make the deselected text background a little fainter
	than the selected text color.

6 april 93 -- (Bug in pt) pt was not terminating tk and the tcl interpreter
	so that it left the X server resource thinking that pt was still
	active.  This meant the next "pt" was named "pt #2" and point
	did not send the "WindowClosed" message to the right interpreter.
	I fixed pt so that it terminates properly.

9 april 93 -- (addition) Added a help line for each menu button.  Thanks
	to Bruno Serra for showing me how to do this.

9 april 93 -- (addition) Added an emacs like control-s incremental search
	lead-in. Thanks to Bruno Serra for showing me how to do this.

19 april 93 -- (??) I removed the #include <tkInt.h> from point.c.
	It was not necessary.  Probably left over from some previous
	code that I removed.   I also change #include <tkInt.h> to
	#include <tk.h> in pt.h.

30 april 93 -- (Bug) The "Again" command would fail if not changes had been
	made in the editor.  Fixed.

14 may 1993 -- Updated the user manual and the man page to include all recent
	changes.

17 may 1993 -- Released version 1.60


------------------17 may 1993------- Version 1.60 ---------------------------

18 may 1993 -- (Addition) Added code to detect when a file loaded into Point
	has been changed (by some agency outside of Point) since Point last
	read it.  The is detected only when a file is about to be written.
	The user is given a choice of going ahead with the write or cancelling
	the write.

18 may 1993 -- (Change) I switched from my makeshift modal boxes to
	ones using the tkwait mechanism and a local grab.  The user visible
	change is that dialogue boxes now execute a grab and no other Point
	things can be done until the dialogue box is closed.  The grab is
	local so you can interact with other X applications.

19 may 1993 -- (Change) Line numbers have been changed so that they work
	better.  They are actually in a separate window from the text but
	you cannot really tell.  Now all editing when line numbers are
	visible should act normally.
	
	(Unfixed bug) There is still a bug with line numbers at the end of
	the file.  The old line numbers do not get erased so the lines
	beyond the end of the file have line numbers.
	
	Also the line numbers are not correct when you scroll.  FIX!!

24 may 1993 -- (Change) Changed the external name "interp" to
	"pointsMainInterp" to avoid conflicts with extended tcl.

24 may 1993 -- (Bugs) Fixed some problems with the Imakefile regarding
	installion

27 may 1993 -- (Bug) Changing text colors from the
	FILE/"Select text colors ..." dialogue box did not work because of
	a previous change in internal interface to the color changing
	procedure.  This was fixed
	
	I also added the ability to change the deselected text foreground
	and background colors.

1 july 1993 -- (Bug) Fixed bug that caused bottomFile to hand in some cases.

26 july 1993 -- (Bug) Fixed problem where right and middle buttons were not
	working in browser file lists.  Also multiple selection was allowed.
	These may be tk3.2 changes I did not catch before.

26 july 1993 -- (Change) One line help now works better.  There is help text
	for the menus and the browser menu bar and the help text disappears
	when you leave the button.

18 oct 1993 -- (Bug) When a point command fails (in tcl.c) sometimes a text
	field (last_command) did not get set and the printf got a
	segmentation fault.  Fix is to set it.

12 nov 1993 -- (Bug) sent string not address of string in fileio.c line 329

12 nov 1993 -- (Bug) added a "class" parameter to the Tk_CreateMainWindow
	call in browser.c line 859 and in pt.c line 53

12 nov 1993 -- (Bug) Fixed the calling sequence of Tcl_Eval in pt.c

15 nov 1993 -- (Release) Released version 1.62

------------------15 nov 1993------- Version 1.62 ---------------------------

16 nov 1993 -- (Change) Changed the calling sequence of "msg" to
	allow the forcing of the message into a popup window.  Also some
	messages now always come up in a window.  The option to put the
	message in the browser message line is eliminated since browsers
	do not have message lines!

16 nov 1993 -- (Bug) The backup mechanism now warns you when it cannot make
	a backup file.

9 dec 1993 -- (Change) Changed "pt" so that the little window does not come
	up (I withdraw it).  Instead it just sends the message to "point".

11 Jan 1994 -- (Bug) The call to Tk_GetFontStruct in repaint.c used a char*
	instead of a Tk_Uid.  Fixed.

12 jan 1994 -- (Change) Changed point so that you can undo over a save.  This
	is done but just not resetting the piece table when a save is done.
	This means that editing could get slow if you make a lot of changes
	without closing the file.  Closing and reopening the window will
	reset the piece table.

12 jan 1994 -- (Display bug) Undo and redo would often leave old selections
	on the screen that were not properly erased.  This has been fixed.

13 jan 1994 -- (Release) Released version 1.63


------------------13 jan 1994------- Version 1.63 ---------------------------
