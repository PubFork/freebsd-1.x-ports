This is vim, a "vi imitation".
To install it under FreeBSD, you need to compile it first
with "make" ( for the BSD-make ) or "gmake" (for the GNU make ).
Then you must install the files by hand. Simply copy the "vim"
executable to /usr/local/bin and the file "doc/vim.hlp" to
/usr/local/doc/vim.hlp. That should be all.
