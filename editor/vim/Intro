Environment: UNIX, AMIGA, MS-DOS

Vim - Vi IMitation. A clone of the UNIX text editor Vi. Very useful for 
editing programs and other plain ASCII text. Full Vi compatibility (except Q 
command) and includes most Ex commands.

Extra features above Vi: Multilevel undo, command line history, improved 
command line editing, command typeahead display, command to display yank 
buffers, possibility to edit binary files, file name stack, support for Manx 
QuickFix, shows current file name in window title, on-line help, etc. 

Version 1.27, update to 1.24. Most important changes:
- 'ignorecase' did not work with UNIX, fixed
- ":s/a/b/ did not work with MSDOS, fixed
- all other reported bugs fixed
- portability for UNIX improved for linux, hpux, pyramid, SCO Xenix, etc.
- improved security for .exrc and .vimrc in current directory
- a few Ex commands added and a few compatibility problems fixed
- added 'compatible' option to switch off a few vi incompatible extentions
- Vim now works on more terminals (e.g. Sun cmdtool)
- with Amiga DOS 2.0 arp.library is no longer needed
- help file is now displayed using terminal codes
- support for locale() with UNIX

Portability: Runs on Amiga, MSDOS and several UNIX versions.

Distribution:
comp.sources.misc: Sources and documentation (shell archive)
comp.binaries.amiga: AMIGA binaries and documentation (lha archive)
comp.binaries.ibm.pc: MSDOS binaries and documentation (lha archive)
(Sorry to post the documentation three times. It is the only way to guarantee 
that everybody gets it. Otherwise people will start asking me for it).

The shell archive contains a few uuencoded files and the reference.doc file
is split up in three. To get the original files back you can use the
"execute.me" script.

Vim is public domain. You are encouraged to put it on ftp servers. It has
already been put on "Aminet". I will ask Fred Fish to put it on one of his
disks.
