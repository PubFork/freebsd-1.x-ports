Vim 1.27        08JUL93

For PC based UNIX-like systems, I recommend changing the escape sequence 
timeout value at line 129 of unix.c from its current value of 1000 timer 
ticks to something more like 100. The current value gives a timeout of about 
2.2 seconds, which, in my opinion, is too long (the original intent was for 
it to be a 1 second timeout). I feel that 0.2 seconds work much better.

This will clear up problems which may occur if, like me, you often hit the 
escape key to ensure that insert mode is terminated before typing in command 
mode commands. With the long timeout, a fast typist will type in several 
commands before the escape sequence times out. Any characters typed will 
become part of the escape sequence, often with frustrating results.
