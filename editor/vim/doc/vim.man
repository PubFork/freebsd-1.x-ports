     VVViiimmm is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It can be used  to
     edit any ASCII text. It is especially useful for editing programs.

     There are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, command  line
     editing,   filename   completion,  on  line  help,  quoting,  etc..  Read
     difference.doc for a summary of the differences between vi and Vim.

     Most often VVViiimmm is started to edit a single file with the command

          vim file

     More generally VIM is started with:

          vim [options] [filelist]

     If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an  empty  buffer.
     Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one
     or more files to be edited.

     file ..     A list of file names. The first one (alphabetically) will  be
                 the current file and read into the buffer. The cursor will be
                 positioned on the first line of the buffer. You  can  get  to
                 the other files with the ":next" command.

     +[num] file ..
                 Same as the above, but the cursor will be positioned on  line
                 "num".  If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned on
                 the last line.

     +/pat file ..
                 Same as the above, but the cursor will be positioned  on  the
                 first   occurrence   of   "pat"  in  the  current  file  (see
                 reference.doc, section "pattern searches" for  the  available
                 search patterns).

     +{command} file ..

     -c {command} file ..
                 Same as the above, but {command} will be executed  after  the
                 file  has  been  read.  {command}  is  interpreted  as  an Ex
                 command. If the {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed
                 in  double  quotes  (this depends on the shell that is used).
                 Example: Vim "+set si" main.c

     -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a
                 "tag",  a  sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the tags
                 file, the associated file becomes the current  file  and  the
                 associated  command  is  executed.  Mostly this is used for C
                 programs. {tag} then should be a function name. The effect is
                 that  the  file  containing that function becomes the current
                 file and the  cursor  is  positioned  on  the  start  of  the
                 function (see reference.doc, section "tag searches").

     -e          Start in quickFix mode. The error file "AztecC.Err"  is  read
                 and  the  first  error  is  displayed.  Further errors can be
                 jumped to with the ":cn" command. See  reference.doc  section
                 5.6.

     The options, if present, must precede the filelist. The  options  may  be
     given in any order.

     -r          Recovery mode. The autoscript  file  is  read  to  recover  a
                 crashed editing session. It has almost the same effect as "-s
                 file.vim".  See  reference.doc,  chapter  "Recovery  after  a
                 crash".

     -v          View mode. The 'readonly' option will be set. You  can  still
                 edit  the  buffer,  but  will  be  prevented  from accidental
                 overwriting a file. If you do want to overwrite a  file,  add
                 an  exclamation  mark  to  the  Ex  command, as in ":w!". The
                 'readonly'  option  can  be  reset  with  ":set  noro"   (see
                 reference.doc, options chapter).

     -n          No autoscript file will be written. Recovery  after  a  crash
                 will  be  impossible.  Handy  if you want to edit a file on a
                 very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can also be done  with  ":set
                 uc=0".

     -s {scriptin}
                 The script file {scriptin} is read.  The  characters  in  the
                 file  are  interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can
                 be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}". If the end of
                 the   file  is  reached  before  the  editor  exits,  further
                 characters are read from the keyboard.

     -w {scriptout}
                 All the characters that you type are  recorded  in  the  file
                 {scriptout},  until  you exit VIM. This is useful if you want
                 to create  a  script  file  to  be  used  with  "vim  -s"  or
                 ":source!".

     -T terminal Tells Vim the name of the terminal you are using. Should be a
                 terminal  known  to  Vim  (builtin) or defined in the termcap
                 file.

     -d device   Open "device" for use as  a  terminal.  Only  on  the  Amiga.
                 Example:  "-d con:20/30/600/150".
