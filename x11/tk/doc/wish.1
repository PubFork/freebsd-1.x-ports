.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwish\fR ?\fIoptions\fR?\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 15
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
.IP "\fB\-file \fIfileName\fR" 15
Read commands from \fIfileName\fR rather than standard input.  The
last element in \fIfileName\fR will be used as the title for the
application and name of its interpreter for \fBsend\fR
commands (unless overridden by the \fB\-name\fR option\fR).
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 15
Initial geometry to use for window.
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 15
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 15
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors
are reported immediately.  This will result in much slower
execution, but it is useful for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBWish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands
from standard input or from a file.  If \fBwish\fR is invoked
with no arguments, it creates a small window and reads Tcl commands
interactively from standard input.  It will continue processing
commands until all windows have been deleted or until end-of-file
is reached on standard input.
.PP
If the \fB\-file\fR option is provided to Tk, then it reads Tcl
commands from the file named in the \fB\-file\fR option.  These
commands will normally create an interactive interface consisting
of one or more widgets.  When the end of the command file is
reached, \fBwish\fR will continue to respond to X events until
all windows have been deleted.
.PP
The \fBwish\fR program provides a few Tcl commands in addition
to those already provided by the Tcl and Tk libraries.  However,
these commands are intended for debugging purposes only and
should not be widely used.  In particular, they will probably
be eliminated in some future release.  If you wish to use these
commands you'll have to read the code to see what they do.
