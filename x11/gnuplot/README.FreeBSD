The Makefile included in this system assumes the existence of
libreadline on your system.  It is in /usr/lib standard in 1.1.5.

You can run "configure" to remake the Makefile to use readline.c
included in this distribution, but the use of libreadline is highly
advised.  You can get it from FreeBSD-current, it should compile on
any 1.1 system.
