FreeBSD port by Satoshi Asami (asami@cs.berkeley.edu)

After xmkmf and make depend, you can just type "make" to use the default
moon bitmap, or "make 1024x768", "make 800x600", "make 600x480" to get
smaller moons suitable for displays of the respective sizes.  If you
want moons of other sizes, look at the end of Imakefile and the shell
script "reducemoon".  Basically all you need to do is "reducemoon F"
followed by a "make", where F is the reduction factor (0.7 for example).

You need the pbmplus package (also available from
freebsd.cdrom.com or the mirror sites) to scale the moon.

                     Distribution of 18sep91
                Previous distribution of 26aug88

Xphoon sets X the root window to a picture of the moon in its current phase.

Files in this distribution:

    README		this
    Imakefile		guess
    xphoon.c		main routine
    moon.c		wrapper for moon bitmap
    phase.c		phase of moon calculations, from phoon and moontool
    dtime.c		extracted from the libtws date/time library
    tws.h		include file from libtws
    vroot.h		include file for virtual root wondow support
    xphoon.man		manual entry
    moon.xbm		moon bitmap

To compile: unpack the shar files, do an xmkmf, 'make unshar' to get
moon.xbm, make depend, make.  Or if you didn't get shar files, just
xmkmf, make depend, make.

Suggestion for those in the southern hemisphere:
    xbmtopbm moon.xbm | pnmflip -r180 > moon ; pbmtoxbm moon > moon.xbm
