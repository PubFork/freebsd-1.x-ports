xlock screen locker

to build:
xmkmf -a # not necessary if you want to use the standard compiler
make
make install

chmod u+s xlock

Also, for maximum security, uncomment the Dontzap option in the Xconfig file.
This will prevent someone from using the ctrl-alt-backspace sequence to kill
the X server.
