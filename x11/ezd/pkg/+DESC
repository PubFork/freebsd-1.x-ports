Ezd is a graphics server that sits between an application program and the X
server and allows both existing and new programs easy access to structured
graphics.  Ezd users have been able to have their programs produce interactive
drawings within hours of reading the man page.

Structured graphics:  application defined graphical objects are ordered into
drawings by the application.  Drawings are displayed by mapping them onto
windows.  Multiple drawings may be mapped onto a window and a drawing may be
mapped onto multiple windows.  Pan and zoom operations are done by remapping
the drawing.  PostScript renderings of a window's contents are produced by a
single command.
