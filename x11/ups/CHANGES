CHANGES BETWEEN UPS VERSIONS 2.31 AND 2.44

  + Support for gcc 2.2.2 on the SPARC.

  + Support for purify.

  + Ported to BSDI BSD/386.

  + Ported to the MIPS RISC/os box by Hal R. Brand and Conor Doherty.

  + Ported to the MIPS-based Sony NEWS box by Nobuyuki Hikichi.

  + Added ->[] operator in the C interpreter - this lets you scan
    backwards and forwards through linked lists as if they were arrays.
    See the manual page.

  + When ups gets a fatal signal or other internal error it now
    dumps core in ups-core/core rather than /tmp/core if there is
    already a core file in the current directory.  It also says where
    it is dumping core.
 
  + You can specify the file of a function or global variable in the
    typing line with the syntax file.c:func.  This is useful when the
    same static function name appears in more than one file.

  + The C interpreter can now see global variables like errno.

  + You can now edit the values of strings and floating point numbers.

  + Ups will now display the hex representation of floating point numbers.

  + X resources are now looked for in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Ups if
    not found any other way.
