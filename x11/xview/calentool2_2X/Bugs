1) If the wpaint.c file is compiled with optimization then the display
   does not get properly refreshed. If an explicit WIN_REPAINT is
   inserted in the code or if optimiztion is not used for this file
   then it all works OK.

		*** Note about XView3/olwm3 ***

The color handling changed in XView 3 so that the background in the windows
defaults to black unless overriden by the -bg/-Wb command line switch. Note
that setting the background in the .Xdefaults does not work. Similarly, the
panel buttons will all be labeled in black unless the -fg/-Wf command line
switch is used. I don't know why this is or (yet) how to fix it.
