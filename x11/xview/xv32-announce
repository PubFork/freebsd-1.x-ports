What Is XView
-------------
XView (X Window-System-based Visual/Integrated Environment for Workstations)
is a user-interface toolkit to support interactive, graphics-based
applications running under the X Window System.  XView provides a set of
pre-built, user-interface objects such as canvases, scrollbars, menus, and
control panels.  The appearance and functionality of these objects follow
the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface (GUI) specification.  XView features
an object-oriented style Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is
straightforward and easy to learn.

New Features of Version 3.2:

	o New File Chooser Object
	o Menu Accelerator functionality
	o New Panel features
	o Lots of bug fixes



What is OLWM:
------------
OLWM is an ICCCM-compliant window manager, also based on the OPEN LOOK GUI.
OLWM is a "stand-alone" window manager, not dependent on any toolkit code.
OLWM provides both 2D and 3D-look OPEN LOOK graphical interfaces through
the usage of the OPEN LOOK graphics library (OLGX).  OLGX is written to the
Xlib interface and does not use any toolkit.



What Libraries are Included:
---------------------------
	- XView			(XView user interface toolkit)
	- OLGX 			(OPEN LOOK Graphics for X)



What XView Applications are Included:
------------------------------------
	- clock
	- cmdtool/shelltool 	(a terminal emulator)


What Contributed Clients are Included:
-------------------------------------
The examples from the XView Programmer's Manual from O'Reilly.
This includes over 70 simple example programs to show features in
each of the XView packages.



XView Requirements
------------------
XView requires the use of an ICCCM-compliant window
manager.  One such window manager is olwm, which supports the OPEN
LOOK (TM) user interface.  Further, XView requires full ICCCM
support in Xlib. This is the standard in the X Window System
Version 11, Release 5. The XView build is dependent on X11R5.
The unpacked XView 3.2 source is ~20meg.
You'll need an additional 18meg to do a complete build. (assuming shared libs)
To install everything, you'll need about 8.5meg.

FTP sites for the XView source:

Location        Machine Name            ftp login       ftp directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------
west coast      xview.ucdavis.edu       ftp             /pub/XView/XView3.2
east coast      export.lcs.mit.edu      ftp             /contrib/xview3.2

When transferring a tar file via ftp, be sure to set binary mode first.
Files must be transferred in image mode (use the ftp "binary" and "mget" 
commands).  If you are doing an "mget" you'll probably want to use 
ftp with the "-i" option to prevent it from asking you about every file.

Building the Release:
--------------------
To build XView, you need the XView source release and installed X11 Release 5
header files, libraries and config directory.

More Information:
----------------
