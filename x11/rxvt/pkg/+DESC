[rxvt is derived from xvt - the most descriptive text for which follows]

Xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less
compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly
intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but
may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.  On
a SPARCstation, an initially invoked xvt uses about 1/3 megabyte of
swap while xterm uses about 1.3 megabytes (obtained by running pstat
rather than ps which seems to give unreliable size figures on SPARCs).
The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use of
the X toolkit.
