 Compressing Files/Directories
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 When a file token is dropped on the "compress" icon, it is
 added to a list of files waiting for compression.  If this
 list was previously hidden, it will become visible.

 The total amount of disk space that could be gained by
 eliminating the files is shown at the top of the dialog
 box.  Presumably, a large portion of this disk space will
 be regained by compression.

 Files can be removed from the compress list using %%
hyperhelp_link drag&drop DragDrop
%%
 facilities to drop them onto an icon:

  %%
label $blt_htext(widget).refileTarget -bitmap refile
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).refileTarget
%% - put file back into directory hierarchy
  %%
label $blt_htext(widget).trashTarget -bitmap trash
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).trashTarget
%% - transfer file to %%
hyperhelp_link \"delete\" Trash
%% list

 Pressing the "Compress Files" button causes all files on
 the list to be compressed.  Directories are converted to
 compressed "tar" files, and ordinary files are simply
 compressed.  If for some reason a file cannot be compressed,
 an error message is displayed and the file is put back onto
 the "compress" list.

 Pressing the "Cancel" button causes all files to be put
 back into the directory hierarchy, and causes the "Compress"
 dialog box to disappear.
