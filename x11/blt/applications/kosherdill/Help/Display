 Graphical Display of Disk Usage
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Relative usage for all files in a given directory is presented
 in a graphical display.  Files are ordered within the display
 according to the options under the %%
hyperhelp_link View Intro ViewMenu
%% menu.

 A typical file is represented showing its name, relative size,
 and numerical size as follows:

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).usage -bitmap ex-usage -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).usage
%% 

 The icon to the left of the file name represents the type of
 the file:

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).file -bitmap new-file -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).file
%% - ordinary file
   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).dir -bitmap new-folder -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).dir
%% - directory

 The same icon also represents the age of the file, according
 to the spider webs displayed in the inner box:

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).newfile -bitmap new-file -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).newfile

label $blt_htext(widget).newdir -bitmap new-folder -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).newdir
%% - "new" file/directory (less than 4 weeks old)
   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).dustyfile -bitmap dusty-file -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).dustyfile

label $blt_htext(widget).dustydir -bitmap dusty-folder -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).dustydir
%% - "dusty" file/directory (4 - 8 weeks old)
   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).oldfile -bitmap old-file -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).oldfile

label $blt_htext(widget).olddir -bitmap old-folder -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).olddir
%% - "old" file/directory (8 - 20 weeks old)
   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).moldyfile -bitmap moldy-file -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).moldyfile

label $blt_htext(widget).moldydir -bitmap moldy-folder -bg $helpbg
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).moldydir
%% - "moldy" file/directory (more than 20 weeks old)

 The definitions for "new", "dusty", "old" and "moldy" shown
 above can be modified using resources in the %%
 hyperhelp_link ".Xdefaults" Xdefaults FileAges
 %% file.

 Clicking with the left mouse button on any file in the display
 causes a rectangle to be drawn around the file.  Double-clicking
 with the left mouse button on a directory loads it into the
 "Directory" heading, and causes its contents to be loaded into
 the graphical display.

 Clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button moves the
 current position in the display.

 Clicking and dragging with the right mouse button initiates
 a %%
hyperhelp_link drag&drop DragDrop
%% operation, for transferring file names to targets
 within the application.

 In the main window, the "Directory" entry is an editable field,
 and the "Directory" label itself provides a menu of higher-level
 directories.  In other usage windows, the "Directory" entry is
 a %%
hyperhelp_link drag&drop DragDrop
%% source/target, but cannot be edited from the keyboard.
