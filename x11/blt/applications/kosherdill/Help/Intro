 Kosher Dill is a simple utility for managing disk usage.  It
 provides a graphical representation of the system "du" command,
 along with drag&drop facilities for exploring, compressing
 and removing files.

 Directory names are entered into the "Directory" entry near the
 top of the main window.  Pressing return in this window invokes
 a query of disk usage ("du") for this directory.  Results are
 displayed in the "Usage" message near the top of the window.
 In addition, a %%
hyperhelp_link "graphical display" Display
%% is generated showing relative
 usage for all immediate sub-directories and files.

 Elements in this display are available for %%
hyperhelp_link "drag&drop" DragDrop
%% operation.
 Files can be dropped on the following targets:

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).examineTarget -bitmap examine
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).examineTarget
%% - used to %%
hyperhelp_link examine Examine
%% the file

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).compressTarget -bitmap compress
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).compressTarget
%% - used to %%
hyperhelp_link compress Compress
%% the file

   %%
label $blt_htext(widget).trashTarget -bitmap trash
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).trashTarget
%% - used to %%
hyperhelp_link delete Trash
%% the file

 Other aspects of this application are controlled by menus
 listed at the top of the main window:

 FILE MENU
   About...       - brings up a message describing this application
   Preferences... - brings up a dialog box for editing %%
hyperhelp_link preferences Preferences
%%
   Quit           - exits the application
%%
hyperhelp_mark ViewMenu
%%
 VIEW MENU
   Changes the display of files in all graphical usage windows:

   By Name 
     List files in alphabetical order by name.
   By Size 
     List files in order from largest to smallest.
   By Age
     List files in order from oldest to newest.

   Files in Local Directory
     Show contents of one directory at a time.
   Files in All Directories
     Show all files in the hierarchy below a given directory.

   All Files
     Show all files, regardless of size.
   Only "Significant" Files
     Show files larger than a "significant" size, as defined in
     the %%
hyperhelp_link preferences Preferences
%% for this application.

  Different combinations of these options are useful in different
  circumstances.  When exploring to find large directories, the
  following settings are useful:

    EXPLORING DIRECTORIES:
    - By Size
    - Files in Local Directory
    - All Files

  This presents a hierarchical view of directories, showing the
  largest ones near the top of the list.  Each directory, in turn,
  can be explored this way.

  When searching for the largest and oldest single files to be
  deleted, the following settings are useful:

    SEARCHING FOR BIG FILES:
    - By Age
    - Files in All Directories
    - Only "Significant" Files

  Such a listing may take a while to process, but when it appears,
  it will contain a number of good candidates (core files, etc.)
  for removal.
