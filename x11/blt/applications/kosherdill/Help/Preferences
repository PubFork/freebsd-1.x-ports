 Preferences
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 Viewing preferences can be modified by selecting the
 "Preferences..." option under the "File" menu.  This brings
 up a dialog box showing the current viewing parameters,
 which can then be modified.

 Selecting the "Apply" button causes the preferences to be
 saved in a file ".kosherdill" in the user's home directory.
 This file will be loaded each time kosherdill is invoked
 to set the initial viewing parameters.
 
 Selecting the "Cancel" button causes the dialog box to
 disappear; any changes that were made are forgotten.

 Setting preferences is useful if you develop a favorite viewing
 style for kosherdill, and if you want that style to be set
 automatically during start-up.  Of course, viewing parameters
 can always be changed during execution, either by setting new
 preferences, or by changing parameters on the %%

%% menu.
