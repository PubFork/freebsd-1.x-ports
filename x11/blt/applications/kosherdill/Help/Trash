 Deleting Files/Directories
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 When a file token is dropped on the "trash" icon, it is
 added to a list of files waiting for removal.  If this
 list was previously hidden, it will become visible.

 The total amount of disk space that will be gained by
 eliminating the files is shown at the top of the dialog
 box.

 Files can be removed from the delete list using %%
hyperhelp_link drag&drop DragDrop
%%
 facilities to drop them onto an icon:

  %%
label $blt_htext(widget).refileTarget -bitmap refile
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).refileTarget
%% - put file back into directory hierarchy
  %%
label $blt_htext(widget).compressTarget -bitmap compress
$blt_htext(widget) append $blt_htext(widget).compressTarget
%% - transfer file to %%
hyperhelp_link \"compress\" Compress
%% list

 Pressing the "Delete Files" button causes all files on
 the list to be deleted.  If for some reason a file cannot
 be deleted, an error message is displayed and the file is
 put back onto the "delete" list.

 Pressing the "Cancel" button causes all files to be put
 back into the directory hierarchy, and causes the "Delete"
 dialog box to disappear.
