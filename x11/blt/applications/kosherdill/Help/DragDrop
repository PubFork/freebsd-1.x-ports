 Drag&Drop Operations
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 By default, drag&drop operations are invoked by clicking on the
 display with the right mouse button; this can be configured,
 however, in the user's %%
hyperhelp_link ".Xdefaults" Xdefaults DragDrop
%% file.

 When a drag&drop operation is invoked, a token window will
 appear to represent the information being transferred.  The
 token window is moved by dragging the mouse pointer with the
 button held down, until the token is over a target window.

 When the token is over a compatible target, the border of
 the token will become raised, and the file icon within the
 token will change color.  When the token is released in this
 state, the file name is transferred to the target, and the
 target's function is invoked.
