    Kosher Dill is a simple utility for managing disk usage.  It
    provides a graphical representation of the system "du" command,
    along with drag&drop facilities for exploring, compressing
    and removing files.

---------

This is version 1.1 of Kosherdill.  

It requires a version of wish with the BLT-1.1 extensions.  

How to make and test Kosherdill:

The following describes how to make and install the Kosherdill
program and libraries.

1. Run ./configure

   Run the auto-configuration script "./configure"

	./configure 

   You will be queried for three things:

      1. a place to install the kosherdill library files.

      2. a place to install the kosherdill shell script.

      3. a version of wish with BLT.

   You can always edit the Makefile by hand if something isn't right.


3. Create the executable shell file "kosherdill".

	make 

   You can now test the program.

	./kosherdill
