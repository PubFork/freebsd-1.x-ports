WorkMan is a graphical tool for playing audio compact discs on a CD-ROM
drive.  It has most of the features available on standalone CD players,
such as a shuffle mode, programmable playlists, and elapsed/remaining
timers.  But it also has extra features, foremost of which is the ability
to store information about CDs in a database, then automatically extract
that information when the CD is inserted later.  WorkMan stores the
artist's name, the disc title, the names of individual tracks, and even
remembers which tracks you don't want to hear!  All in an easy-to-use,
attractive OPEN LOOK graphical interface.

Disc databases may be shared among any number of users on the network.
WorkMan keeps separate databases for your private information about
CDs (e.g. which order you like the tracks to play) and the discs' public
information.  During WorkMan's alpha test, several users shared my
database, which now contains over 750 CDs.  That database is available
via anonymous ftp from ftp.hyperion.com in the "WorkMan" directory.

To build WorkMan, Sun users should be able to type "make" and sit
back.  See the file INSTALLATION for more details.  WorkMan requires
XView 3.0 or higher (which comes with the OpenWindows distribution,
and is also available as part of X11R5.)

The manual page (workman.man) contains a brief description of the user
interface, though for the most part you should be able to start using
the tool right away without reading the docs.  If you're curious about
the program's innards, the workmandb.man manual page describes the
database file format.

I'd like to thank the 100+ people from all over the world who participated
in WorkMan's beta test phase, providing encouragement and hitting me over
the head with bug reports at all hours of the night.  And special thanks
to Chris Ross and John Brezak, without who WorkMan would still be a
Sun-only program.
