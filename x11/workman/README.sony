WorkMan was ported to NEWS-OS 6.0 by Tatsuo Nagamatsu, nagamatu@sm.sony.co.jp.
It requires the XView toolkit version 3.0 or higher.

To compile, use "xmkmf" or "imake" to generate a Makefile from the included
Imakefile.  Then type "make" and everything should compile.

If additional steps are required, please let me (koreth@hyperion.com) know so
I can update this file.

Enjoy!
