WorkMan requires XView version 3 or higher.  This is supplied by default on Sun
systems (though you may have to select the "OpenWindows Developers" category
from your SunOS or Solaris CD to get the necessary files for compiling.)  Check
the README file for your machine if you're using something other than SunOS 4,
as there may be additional usage information there.

How you build WorkMan depends on which platform you're trying to build it on.

SunOS 4.x:
	Just type "make".

Solaris 2.x:
	Edit "Makefile" and uncomment the SOL2 and LIBLOC lines.  Then type
	"make".

ULTRIX:
NEWS-OS:
BSD/386:
	Run "imake" or "xmkmf" to convert the supplied Imakefile to a Makefile.
	Or edit the Makefile to point to the right directories.

HP-UX:
	Edit "Makefile.hpux" to point to the correct directories, then type
	"make -f Makefile.hpux" to build WorkMan.

Linux:
	Same as HP-UX, but use "Makefile.linux" instead.

SVr4 4.0:
	Edit "Makefile.svr4" to point to the right directories, then type
	"make -f Makefile.svr4".

Some of the Makefiles assume that OPENWINHOME is set to the OpenWindows 3.x
home directory.  Some tweaking will probably be required if you're not using
OpenWindows; OPENWINHOME is used to locate the XView include files and
libraries.

Once the executable is built, install it in your favorite directory for such
things.  The file "workman.info" should be placed in the XView help directory,
usually $OPENWINHOME/lib/help.  If you put it somewhere else, be sure to set
your HELPPATH environment variable to point to that directory.  This is
necessary if you want to use the Help key to see the controls' descriptions.
Run "make install" to install everything under $OPENWINHOME.  You will probably
need to be root to do this.

Once all that's done, you're ready to rock and roll (or jazz, or...)

SunOS 4.x and HP-UX users may want to use the "-e" option; see the manual
page for details.
