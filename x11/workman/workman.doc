NAME
     workman - play audio compact discs on a SCSI CD player

SYNOPSIS
     workman [ _g_e_n_e_r_i_c-_t_o_o_l-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s ] [ -bdoeXnhC ] [  -p  pid-
     file ] [ -c device ] [ -s cmd ] [ -l n ] [ -V n ]

DESCRIPTION
     workman is a graphical tool for playing audio compact  discs
     on  a  SunCD drive or other compatible unit.  It has most of
     the features available on standalone CD players, such  as  a
     shuffle  mode, programmable playlists, and elapsed/remaining
     timers.  But it also has extra features, foremost  of  which
     is the ability to store information about CDs in a database,
     then automatically extract that information when the  CD  is
     inserted  later.  Workman stores the artist's name, the disc
     title, the names of individual tracks,  and  even  remembers
     which tracks you don't want to hear!  All in an easy-to-use,
     attractive OPEN LOOK graphical interface.

     Its only weakness, in fact, is that this is the end  of  the
     Description section of the manpage.

OPTIONS
     generic-tool-arguments
          WorkMan  should  accept  the  generic  tool   arguments
          described  in xview(1).  The exception is the -Ws argu-
          ment,  which  can  cause  problems  such  as   the   CD
          Info/About/Goodies buttons being whited out.  Note that
          olwm's "Save Workspace" menu option puts a -Ws argument
          in  your  .openwin-init  file;  you  should edit it and
          remove -Ws and the two numbers following it.

          Of particular note is the -_s_c_a_l_e option, which controls
          the window size.  Use -_s_c_a_l_e _s_m_a_l_l to shrink the window
          so it takes less screen space.

     -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y [+|-]_x[+|-]_y
          Set WorkMan's position on the screen.  Do  not  try  to
          use  -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y  to resize the window; it won't work and
          can mess up the display.  If the Y coordinate is  nega-
          tive (e.g.  -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y +_1_0_0-_5_0) the window will be posi-
          tioned that many pixels from the bottom of  the  screen
          and  will grow and shrink from the top, rather than the
          bottom; this prevents the controls from  moving  around
          when  multiline track titles are displayed, and is fre-
          quently used with the -_l _0 option.  Note that the  win-
          dow  manager will add its title bar and push the window
          down.  Use something like -_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y +_0-_3_8  to  position
          the  window  at  the  bottom  of the screen.  38 is the
          height of the olwm border; use other values  for  other
          window managers.

     -_d   Don't display any title information in the main window.
          This  results  in  a  smaller  main  window.  The title
          information can still be seen and edited using  the  CD
          Info  popup.   If  -_d  is used twice, title information
          will be displayed only if it is available; the  default
          is  to display "Unknown CD name", "Unknown artist", and
          "Unknown track name" when the corresponding information
          is unavailable.

     -_D _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          Set the location of the CD database file.   This  is  a
          colon-separated  list  of filenames.  This option over-
          rides the value of the WORKMANDB  environment  variable
          and   the   workman.db.shared  resource  if  either  is
          present.  See the ENVIRONMENT section for more details.

     -_h   Display a summary of options.

     -_b   Toggle the use of Dismiss buttons on all popups  and  a
          Quit  button  on  the main window.  Useful for users of
          window managers other than olwm.  On Sun and  DEC  sys-
          tems,  Dismiss  buttons  are  missing by default; on HP
          systems, they are shown by default.

     -_c _d_e_v_i_c_e
          Use a device other than the default (/dev/rdsk/c0t6d0s2
          or  /vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0  under  Solaris 2, /dev/sr0
          under Solaris 1, /dev/rsr0 under Linux, and  /dev/rscsi
          under  HPUX).   This  is useful if the CD drive is on a
          second SCSI controller,  or  more  than  one  drive  is
          present on the system.

     -_s _c_m_d
          Send a command to a  running  workman  process.   Valid
          values are stop, play, pause, back, forward, and eject.
          Only the first character is  examined,  except  in  the
          case  of  play  and  pause  (which require at least two
          characters).  mute and go are  aliases  for  pause  and
          play, respectively.

     -_o   This option prevents the Solaris 2.1 version of workman
          from  spawning  a  background job to keep the CD device
          open.  There is a bug in Solaris 2.1 that causes the CD
          player  to  stop when its device is opened, unless some
          other process on the  system  already  has  the  device
          open.   When this option is specified, the CD will stop
          playing if workman is exited then restarted.  When  the
          background job is present (-_o is absent) the eject but-
          ton on the CD player does not work even after  quitting
          from  workman.   The background job isn't started under
          Solaris 2.2 if the volume manager is running.

     -_l _n Reserve some lines for track titles in the main window.
          If  _n  is  a  positive number, that many lines of track
          title will always be displayed, even if some are blank.
          If  _n  is zero, the main window will grow and shrink to
          accomodate multiline titles.  If  _n  is  negative  (the
          default), the main window will grow when necessary, but
          will never shrink, even when a shorter title is  subse-
          quently displayed.

     -_e   Check once for the presence of a CD at startup.  If  no
          CD  is  present, wait for the user to select the square
          (stop) icon from the main window.  The  default  is  to
          check for a CD every 5 seconds; on some SunOS versions,
          the CD-ROM driver prints a message to the console every
          time  the  tool  checks  for a CD.  After a CD has been
          detected once,  workman  will  revert  to  its  default
          behavior (since the driver message only occurs if work-
          man has not yet found a CD in the drive.)   Specify  -_e
          more  than  once  to  disable checking for CD insertion
          permanently.

     -_X   Exit automatically when the CD is ejected.

     -_p _f_i_l_e
          Write the program's process ID to a different _f_i_l_e.  By
          default,  the PID is written to "/tmp/.wm_pid" to allow
          signals to be sent more easily (see the SIGNALS section
          below.)

     -_n   No file locking.  On some  systems,  workman's  use  of
          file  locking  is a significant performance hit (and on
          older systems, file locking didn't work  too  well;  on
          those  machines, workman can freeze up when it tries to
          lock the database file.)  Use of  this  option  is  not
          recommended  when  several  people share a database via
          NFS; if two people save CD entries to the  database  at
          the  same  time and one of them is not using file lock-
          ing, one or both of the new entries may  be  erased  or
          stored incorrectly.

          Apply  Sun  patch  100075  to  your  system  (and  your
          fileserver,  if you're NFS-mounting the database files)
          and you probably won't need to use the -n flag at all.

     -_V _n Set minimum volume.  CD-ROM drives  made  by  different
          manufacturers  have  different  volume-setting methods.
          On the Sun and DEC CD-ROM drives, the  volume  settings
          range  from 0 to 255, but only values of 128 or greater
          produce any sound.  On some third-party drives, though,
          the  full  range of volumes is available, in which case
          running with -_V _0 is desirable.  The default is 128.

     -_C   Close the CD device when  the  disc  is  ejected.   You
          shouldn't  need  to  use  this  option  unless you have
          unreliable hardware.

RESOURCES
     The following resources are available.  All  resource  names
     begin with "workman.".

     db.personal (string, default $HOME/.workmanrc)
          The pathname of a file containing  personal  preference
          information  about  CDs:  track volumes, playlists, and
          the  like.   This  resource  overrides  the   WORKMANRC
          environment variable, if present.

     db.shared (string, default $HOME/.workmandb)
          A  colon-separated  list  of  database   files.    This
          resource  overrides  the WORKMANDB environment variable
          and in turn may be overridden by  the  -_D  command-line
          option.   See the ENVIRONMENT section for more informa-
          tion about using lists of databases.

     initialVolume (integer, default varies)
          When a CD is inserted for the first time, or WorkMan is
          started  when there is already a disc in the drive, the
          current volume level is read from the drive.   On  some
          systems  the  volume  can't  be obtained, in which case
          WorkMan by default will set the volume to  100%.   This
          resource  allows  a different initial volume to be set.
          Valid values are 0 through 100.

     smallButtons (boolean, default varies)
          If true, use small (16x16) icons  for  the  main  panel
          buttons.   If false, use the old 32x16 icons.  If unde-
          fined, the program will try to  use  the  correct  size
          depending  on  how big the rest of the window is, which
          can be controlled with the XView "-scale"  command-line
          option or by using a particular font.

     autoPlay (string, default "normal")
          Controls whether  or  not  WorkMan  will  automatically
          start  playing  a  CD when it's inserted.  Valid values
          are "never", "normal", and "always".  The default is to
          play  the CD if the personal database says to do so, or
          according to the "Auto-play Unknown CDs" setting in the
          Goodies popup if the CD isn't in the personal database.

ENVIRONMENT
     WORKMANRC
          The location of the personal  preferences  file.   This
          file  contains  information such as the default volumes
          of CDs, playlists, and the numbers of tracks  to  avoid
          playing.   It is usually not shared among several users

          of workman, since it does not contain  any  information
          about the CDs themselves.

     WORKMANDB
          Specifies the location  of  the  CD  database  file  or
          files.   Several  files  may be specified by separating
          them with colons a la the  PATH  shell  variable.   For
          example,          setting          WORKMANDB         to
          "$HOME/.workmandb:/home/user2/.workmandb"  would  cause
          workman  to  look  first  in  $HOME/.workmandb, then in
          /home/user2/.workmandb.  New entries are saved  to  the
          first  database in the list; modified entries are saved
          to the database in which they were originally found, or
          the first database if the original one is not writable.

          This   variable's   value   is   overridden   by    the
          workman.db.shared  resource  and by the -_D command-line
          option.

SIGNALS
     WorkMan reacts to the following signals:

     SIGTTOU
          Jump to the next track.

     SIGTTIN
          Jump to the previous track.

     SIGUSR1
          Pause the CD (if it's playing).

     SIGUSR2
          Play the CD (if it's paused or stopped).

     SIGQUIT
          Stop the CD if it's playing.

     SIGEMT
          Eject the CD.

     These signals, in combination with the pidfile (see  the  -_p
     option  description  above),  allow simple control of the CD
     player from programs or scripts, and  are  used  by  the  -_s
     option.

INTERFACE
     Most controls have spot help; hit the Help key (F1 on type-3
     keyboards)  over  a  control  to find out what it does.  The
     following is a quick rundown of the controls; for  the  most
     part, they're pretty self-explanatory.

  The main window
     The  main  window  contains  the  basic  display  and   most
     commonly-used controls.  Moving from top to bottom and read-
     ing left to right, you'll see:

     The artist's name.

     The name of the CD or the  title  of  the  currently-playing
     piece of music, if it takes up more than one track.

     The title of the current track.  This may occupy  more  than
     one row on the screen.

     The track selection buttons.   Click  on  these  buttons  to
     select  a starting track, or to change to a new track if the
     CD is playing.

     The track-position slider.  This is  updated  once  every  5
     seconds  while  the  CD is playing; you can also use it as a
     sort of jog dial to move around in a track.

     The volume slider.  Up is louder; down is quiet.

     The main controls (for lack of a better term.)  The  buttons
     on  the  top  row move to the previous track, start playing,
     and move to the next track, respectively.  The  bottom  but-
     tons  pause,  stop, or eject the CD.  When the CD is paused,
     playing may be resumed by clicking on either the pause  but-
     ton or the play button.

     The "stop mode" selector.  When workman is  done  playing  a
     CD,  it  can  stop,  play the CD over again (the _R_e_p_e_a_t set-
     ting), or eject it.  Click the MENU mouse button to select a
     stop  mode;  or  click SELECT on the pull-down item to cycle
     through the available choices.

     The "play mode" selector.  This determines the playing order
     of the tracks.  Two selections are always available: _N_o_r_m_a_l,
     which plays the CD from start to  end,  and  _S_h_u_f_f_l_e,  which
     plays the tracks in random order.  In addition, if any play-
     lists have been defined, they'll appear here as well.

     A gauge indicating how long the CD has been playing and  how
     much longer is left.

     Three buttons that bring up the About, CD Info, and  Goodies
     popups.

  The About popup
     There's not much to say about this; it's the credits with  a
     couple of dumb pictures.

  The CD Info popup
     This popup is used to enter information about a CD.   Again,
     from the top:

     The artist's name.

     The title of the CD as a whole.

     A scrolling list of tracks and their titles.   This  can  be
     used  to  view  the  tracks on a CD, or to select tracks for
     editing using the controls below.

     The name of the track that's selected on the scrolling list.
     As  a  shortcut,  if  RETURN is typed after entering a track
     name,  the  scrolling  list  selection  will   automatically
     advance  to  the next track.  This allows you to type in all
     the track titles without using the mouse.  The  track  title
     can  contain  several  special  symbols  that alter the main
     window's display.  "//" forces a line break; the text  after
     the  "//" will be displayed below the text before it.  Work-
     Man will automatically split lines that are too big for  the
     main  window.   If a line begins with "+", the main window's
     disc title display is replaced with the text after  the  "+"
     (useful for classical CDs, with several tracks that are part
     of the same work.)  If a line  begins  with  "@",  the  main
     window's  artist display is replaced with the text after the
     "@" (useful for  compilation  CDs  with  tracks  by  several
     artists.)   Both "+" and "@" may be used alone on a line, in
     which case the program uses the title  or  artist  from  the
     previous  track.  If a line is empty, the corresponding line
     from the previous track is used.  For example, a track title
     "@Orff//+Carmina  Burana////Stetit  Puella" will replace the
     artist's  name  with  "Orff",  the  CD  name  with  "Carmina
     Burana",  and  display  two lines of track title, the second
     "Stetit Puella" and the first copied from the first line  of
     title  from  the previous track.  (If this sounds confusing,
     don't worry -- play with it for a few minutes and you'll see
     how it works.)

     The "Continuation"  selector.   If  this  is  selected,  the
     current  track  is a continuation of the previous one.  This
     is taken into account when the CD is played in shuffle mode;
     if,  for example, three tracks are part of the same piece of
     music (indicated by setting "Continuation" on the second and
     third tracks), they will be played together in shuffle mode.

     The "Don't play" selector.  If this is selected, the program
     will  avoid  the  track  when playing the CD (though you can
     still play the track by selecting it directly using the main
     window's track selection buttons.)

     The default volume setting.  Use this if a  particular  disc
     or  track should be played especially loudly or quietly.  If
     the slider is all the way to the left, there is  no  default
     setting and the current volume will be used.

     The default play mode setting.  When the CD is inserted, the
     main  window's  play  mode selector will be set according to
     this item.  "From List" will select the first playlist.

     The auto-play setting.  If this is  selected,  the  CD  will
     start  playing automatically when it's inserted (even if the
     main window is closed to an icon!)

     Apply and Reset buttons.  Apply will save the CD information
     to disk.  Reset undoes any changes you've made.

     A button to bring up the "Playlists" popup.

  The Playlists popup
     This contains the controls for creating  user-defined  play-
     lists.  Any number of playlists may be created, and they can
     be as long as you like (until your workstation runs  out  of
     memory, anyway.)  The controls:

     A scrolling list, from which you can select  a  playlist  to
     edit or maim.

     The name of a scrolling list to create, or the new name  for
     the current list.

     A button which creates a new list, using the name above or a
     boring system-generated one if no name has been entered.

     A button to rename the current list to whatever  is  in  the
     Name field.

     A button to delete the current list.

     The tracks in the current playlist.  To add tracks, use  the
     popup menu (which appears when you hit the MENU mouse button
     over the scrolling list.) The popup menu is pinnable, so you
     can keep it on the screen and select tracks quickly.

     A button to delete the  currently-selected  track  from  the
     playlist.

  The Goodies popup
     This popup contains some infrequently-used,  perhaps  frivo-
     lous, controls:

     The balance setting.

     The time display settings.  The running times to the left of
     the  slider  and gauge in the main window can display either
     elapsed time (the default) or remaining time; use  these  to
     choose.

     The auto-play setting for unknown CDs (CDs which you haven't
     seen  before,  or  which  you saw before but didn't Apply to
     your database file from the CD Info  window.)   If  this  is
     selected, unknown CDs will be played when they're inserted.

     The controls for the A-B repeat function.  While the  CD  is
     playing,  click the Start button to mark the start of a pas-
     sage to be repeated; then click the End button when  the  CD
     reaches  the  end of the passage.  Click on the "Repeat sec-
     tion of CD" item to start  repeating  the  passage  (and  to
     stop, once you've started.)

     The Split button.  This button allows you to split any track
     in  two.   Select  a track from the main window, and use the
     track-position slider to choose the split point.   Then  hit
     the  Split button and the track will be divided.  You can do
     everything with the new section that you can with a  regular
     track, including choosing a name.  Tracks may be split while
     the CD is stopped or paused, or while it's playing.  This is
     useful  if  you  wish  to  mark  a  section  of  a song, for
     instance; you can listen for the start of the  section,  and
     hit Split as soon as you hear it beginning.

     The Delete button.  Use this to put a  split-up  track  back
     together.  You can't delete the first section of a track.

     A button to scan for index marks.  If a CD already has  sec-
     tions marked via index marks (usually indicated in the liner
     notes), hit this button to search for them.   Searching  for
     marks  can  take  a  while  depending  on the particular CD.
     Every time an index mark is encountered, its track  will  be
     split as if you'd used the Split button.

FILES
     $HOME/.workmanrc
          Default location of  personal  preferences  file.   See
          WORKMANRC  under  "Environment"  as  well as  workmandb

BUGS
     The program leaks memory with XView 3.0 (but  not  3.0.1  or
     higher)  due  to  a library bug.  The leak only occurs while
     the About popup is displayed.

     Due to another library bug, the program will dump core  when
     the  default  volume  slider is wiggled back and forth under
     Solaris 2.  (The Sun bug ID is 1097908.)

     There is no way to choose a playlist other  than  the  first
     one as the default.

     Some of the options and environment variables should be done
     with X resources or a properties sheet.

     The database should have an index of some sort  for  quickly
     looking  up  CDs,  since the current linear search can get a
     little slow on big databases.

     Interaction with data CDs, especially ones that are  mounted
     as  filesystems,  is  spotty  at  best.   The program should
     unmount a CD before ejecting it.

     The CD Info  popup's  interaction  with  mouseless  mode  is
     annoying.

     If the volume manager  (Solaris  2.2)  is  running  and  the
     "eject"  program  is  used  to eject the CD, a message about
     loading an unnamed CD will appear on the  console.   There's
     nothing WorkMan can do to avoid that.

     The program's name is a pretty moronic pun.
