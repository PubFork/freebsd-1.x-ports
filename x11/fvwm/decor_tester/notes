In this directory is a trimmed down version of rclock, modified to
set MWM decoration hints. This will be used to develop mwm hint processing
capability in fvwm.

Results from running the tester under mwm:
rclock     - Absolutely no decorations. 1 pixel undecorated border
rclock -decor 0 - same as above
rclock -decor 1 - All decorations applied
rclock -decor 2 - A narrow border is displayed (5 pixels - 2 relief, 1 top,
						 2 shadow)
rclock -decor 4 - A wide border, with corner tiles is desplayed

*********************************************************
rclock -func 1 - move, size, iconify, maximum size, lower, raise, kill (close)
       -func ? - as expected. lower,raise are always there, as is
		 normal-size (shaded out).

	function hints impact the decoration hints, ie, if I leave
	minimize out of the function hints, there's no iconify button!
