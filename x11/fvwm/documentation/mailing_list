Okay, I set it up...

To subscribe:

mail to majordomo@shrug.org with the body of the message:

subscribe fvwm

That's all there is to it.  To send to the list, mail to fvwm@shrug.org, or to  
get me direclty mail to fvwm-request@shrug.org

You may want to advertise this with the source, perhaps even include a  
mailing.list file in the root of the source distribution that explains how to  
join.
