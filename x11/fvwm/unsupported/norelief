Subject: fvwm suggestions

Well, now that the sluggish move/resize border has been repaired, only
two things keep fvwm from being the perfect window manager:

  1. Since fvwm is the untimate minimalist (yet usable) window
    manager, with roots in twm, the fact that the decorative chiseled
    borders CANNOT be disabled is simply unforgivable (and I want my
    money back! ;-).

  2. Although this may have been a conscious design choice (to fully
    support mouseless use?), I dislike the fact that, unlike twm,
    keystrokes I type while a window is waiting to be placed are
    DISCARDED.

Here's a patch I wrote that takes a quick&dirty approach (and isn't very
binary-size efficient) to correcting problem #1.  I'd LIKE to get rid of
the extra black line around inactive windows, too, but haven't figured
out how yet.

_______________PATCH DESCRIPTION_______________
norelief: Allows removal of 3-D chiseled edges via a compile-time
    option (-DNORELIEF)

Feel free to clean this up, integrate it, throw it into

way, Thank you for an almost-perfect window manager!
