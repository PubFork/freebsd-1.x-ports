I am collecting patches which provide features that I don't
really think belong in the main fvwm release here. Anyone who
wants to include one should mail it to me. Note that these
patches may not apply cleanly to the current
fvwm release, because, unfortunately, I don't have time to test them.
I have tried to keep the path author's name in the file with the patches, so
that people can contact the patch author if they need to.


FancyTitles: lets you put the current time in the window title
             of the active window.

abort: allows you to cancel window move and resize operations with the
       escape key, I think.

execdir: allows fvwm to create a menu which lets the user
         exec any file in a directory.

m4: patches are now built in to the main distribution

save_desktop: now a module

user_cursors: Allows use of cursors defined as bitmaps, instead of 
    just the X11 default cursors.

force_mono: patches to make fvwm come up only in monochrome mode.
           may be useful for greyscale systems, or systems with a 
	   small number of colors.

no_icon_titles: allows fvwm to omit icon labels on selected icons

norelief: causes fvwm to omit the 3-D look.

toggle_pager: allows you to toggle the pager on and off.

no_icon_titles: allows you to specify which icon box each icon goes in.
