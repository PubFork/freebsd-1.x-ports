The library is designed to hide as much of the details of TIFF as
possible.  In particular, TIFF directories are read in their entirety
into an internal format.  Only the tags known by the library are
available to a user and certain tag data may be maintained that a user
doesn't care about (e.g. transfer function tables).

See the README that comes with the sources for more details.
This package is used by a number of other ports, like xv and pbmplus.
