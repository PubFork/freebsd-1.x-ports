This port requires tcl and tk to compile and will attempt to re-make
them first, if possible.  If you don't have X on your system at all,
the Tk stage of the build will probably fall over.  You should be able
to simply cd to this directory and "make", but if you feel the need
to `configure' again, you can ignore these warnings:

INCROOT: not found
USRLIBDIR: not found

They're harmless.
