              This procedure generates a report from data collect
              from  the profile command.  ProfDataVar is the name
              of the array containing the data  returned  by  the
              profile command. SortKey indicates which data value
              to sort by.  It should be one of "calls", "cpu"  or
              "real".   StackDepth is the stack depth to consider
              significant.  A value of  1  reports  by  procedure
              only,  a  value  of  2 reports by procedure and its
              caller, etc. OutFile is the name of file  to  write
              the  report  to.   If  omitted,  stdout is assumed.
              UserTitle is an optional title line to add to  out-
              put.
