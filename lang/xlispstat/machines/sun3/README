Sun 3's under OS 3.X are generic BSD systems. No additional
modifications to the Makefile are needed. Under OS 4.X if you want to
use dynamic loading you need to add

	-Bstatic

to the ULDFLAGS variable in the Makefile to disable shared labraries.
To use Sun's OpenLook vesion of X11 distributed with OS 4.1 and up
you need to add

	-I/usr/openwin/include

to the UCFLAGS variable, and define the X11LIBDIR variable as

	/usr/openwin/lib

(assuming your openwin stuff is installed in the standard place).
