Under OS 4.X if you want to use dynamic loading you need to add

	-Bstatic

to the ULDFLAGS variable in the Makefile to disable shared labraries.
Otherwise sun4 a.out seems to be close enough to standard BSD to use
the same foreign.h files as sun3 and vax.

To use Sun's OpenLook vesion of X11 distributed with OS 4.1 and up
you need to add

	-I/usr/openwin/include

to the UCFLAGS variable, and define the X11LIBDIR variable as

	/usr/openwin/lib

(assuming your openwin stuff is installed in the standard place).
