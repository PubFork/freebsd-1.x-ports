This directory contains Lisp and C files for compiling and running
XLISP-STAT on the Macintosh with Lightspeed C or MPW 3.0 C. 

For compiling under Lightspeed C 3.0 the project file is set up for
compiling the 68881 version. To compile the generic version make the
obvious change in xmath.h, change the compiler options, replace the
appropriate libraries and go.

For compiling under MPWC change the variable definitions at the
beginning of the make file to select the 68020/68881 version or the
generic verion. The define in xmath.h is not relevant for MPW C.
