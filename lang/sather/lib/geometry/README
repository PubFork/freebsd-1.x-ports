This directory contains Sather classes implementing a variety of geometric
structures and operations.

README: This file.

TEST.sa: Test all geometry classes: GEOMETRY_CLASSES_TEST.

matrix.sa: Matrix operations: MATRIX, NR_SVD, MATRIX_TEST.

vector.sa: General vectors and lists of vectors: VECTOR, VECTOR_LIST, 
   VECTOR_TEST.

vector_low.sa: Vectors in low-dimensional spaces (special versions for
   extra efficiency): VECTOR_2, VECTOR_3, VECTOR_2_LIST, VECTOR_3_LIST,
   VECTOR_LOW_TEST.

vector_map.sa: Mappings from one vector space to another. All such
   maps should inherit from this class so that the general tools are
   applicable. Contains a variety of classes for constructing new maps
   from old ones: VECTOR_MAP, COMPOSITION_VECTOR_MAP{M1,M2},
   PRODUCT_VECTOR_MAP{M1,M2}, SUBSET_VECTOR_MAP, RANGE_VECTOR_MAP,
   CONSTANT_VECTOR_MAP, LEARNED_VECTOR_MAP, LINEAR_VECTOR_MAP,
   AFFINE_VECTOR_MAP, VECTOR_MAP_TEST.
