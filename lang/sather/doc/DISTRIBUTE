* FUNCTION: short memo how to proceed with a distribution
* HISTORY:
*  Oct 17 01:21 1993 (hws): add SATHER_ENVI and adapt to new make setup
* Created: Sun Dec 15 21:12:09 1991 (hws)
*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current Sather directory should contain the latest stable
development version.

To set up a Sather distribution:

1. Edit the file make/config.in:

	RELEASEVERSION =  a new release number

2. Run the top level config step:

	setenv SATHER_HOME <development home>
        cd $SATHER_HOME
	configure -TOPDIR $SATHER_HOME

3. Generate the boot compiler. The boot compiler is a C output of the
   current compiler run on the current compiler. It is generated as
   follows:

        cd $SATHER_HOME/compiler
        make boot-create

4. Check permissions and related items before copying or tar'ing:
   
   Is your "umask" appropriate for what you want the distribution to be?
   The current setting in Makefile.in defines SATHER_DIST_UMASK as 022.
   This makes distribution files at least group writable and others readable. 
   So others can restrict this further when installing.

   Perhaps you want to switch to a new default group, "newgrp sather"?

5. Remove junk directories in development version BUT DO NOT "make clean"
   NEVER EVER USE THIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM. "make clean" is written
   for cleaning a build directory. 

6. Create the distribution directory:

             cd $SATHER_HOME
             make DISTDIR=mypath dist

    This will create a copy of the relevant files in the DISTDIR which
    defaults to $HOME/sather/dist. The mask 022 grants group and others
    read permission. Choose 002 for group write / others read combination.
    Cf. umask for details.

    make dist will also do some cleaning (i.e. call "make clean" and 
    remove *.o *~ core ...), and will tar everything up in 
    sather-$RELEASEVERSION.tar.Z

7. Test install the distribution following the steps in INSTALL
   pedantically, in an environment with SATHER_HOME, SATHER_ENVI, SATHER_MAKE
   not unset.

   7.1 untar the file, 
   7.2 set the top level make/DEFSITE variables and
   7.3 type "make config" and then "make".

   This should work with SATHER_HOME = TOPDIR and with SATHER_HOME
   different from TOPDIR. If different, the user is supposed to follow with
   "make install". 
   TOPDIR is the directory that the tar file gets untarred into and
   where the boot compiler is compiled etc.  SATHER_HOME may be different
   if the user decides to place it in a site "directory" and/or clean
   some unneeded libraries or the boot compiler.

   The user should also be allowed to run "make clean" and then a similar
   installation for another system/architecture within the same
   sather directory tree. This is supposed to use the same intermediate
   file names but will save the results in unique architecture-dependent
   directories like bin.sun4 etc.

   An alpha version of a new distribution can be made from the dist
   directory. It contains the bare minimum to compile and install the 
   system and may be useful to test installation procedures and compiler.

        setenv SATHER_HOME <distpath>
	cd $SATHER_HOME/make
	configure
	cd ..
	make -n bare
	make bare

8. How to distribute...

       * 128.32.201.55  USA     /pub/sather       ftp.ICSI.Berkeley.EDU
       * 129.26.8.90    EUROPE  /pub/Sather       ftp.gmd.DE
       * 133.137.4.3    JAPAN   /pub/lang/sather  sra.CO.JP
       * 192.41.146.1   AUS     /pub/sather       lynx.csis.dit.CSIRO.AU

Login to the distribution hosts and to the ftp host, cd to
~ftp/<pubsatherdir> on the ftp host, and get the new version via anon
ftp from the distribution host, adapt the README, perhaps split the
new version.

A 2.5MB (2528931 bytes) bare alpha version (get from AUS) takes about:

   CSIRO -> ANU, chara (sun):        16 seconds (160 Kbytes/s)
   CSIRO -> ANU, vulcan (sequent):  270 seconds (9.2 Kbytes/s)   
   AUS -> EUR gmdzi:                390 seconds (6.4 Kbytes/s)
   AUS -> USA icsib:                750 seconds (3.3 Kbytes/s)
