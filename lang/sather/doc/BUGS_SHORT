			BUGS AND SHORTCOMINGS
			=====================

1. Sdb, the Sather debugger, is still restricted to Suns. You need to
install the appropriate version of the GNU degubber for your platform.
sdb: Gdb 4.0.1 Aug 91 is all plain and many different architectures. To
make sdb work on top of it, use $ARCHxxx.c names if possible in make
step, or if that does not work, make a debugger/C.$ARCH directory
containing just the necessary files for ARCH and let make link into
them when building for ARCH.

2. Relocation of the sather tree works ok. However incremental compilation
depends on timestamping absolute file names for now. The Sather compiler
will not detect that compilation could be incremental. You can control
incremental compilation by how many and which classes you place in
a single file. In the extreme case, each class is a file and 
incremental compilation is fine-tuned. Typically it makes more
sense to include tightly interdependent classes in a single file,
where changes in one class are likely to require change in another 
class.

3. There was a timing test that ran into a DOUBLE error.

4. one etc/bugs error persists: LIST{LIST{B}} not subtype
$LIST{LIST{$A} if B subtype A.

5. The Sequent port has a hack for "fmod" making some floating point
operations loose, that use it. Particularly some test cases in the 
vector and random number tests seem to compare -0 with +0 now.
The compability hacks for missing functions are in sys/C/envivars_.c
for now.

6. The "French" bug persists. It appears to be attribute access
problem in connection with dead code elimination. Look at it when
rewriting attribute allocation and access to get the Alpha alignment
problems sorted out.
