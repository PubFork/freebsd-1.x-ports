Compiler and make flags to build the Sather system.

To configure you type "configure" in this directory.
You may have to pass arguments to "configure" or edit the file DEFSITE
before invoking "configure".

SEE $SATHER_HOME/doc/INSTALL for details.

type "./config.guess" to see what environment will be guessed.
type "./arch.guess"   to see supported symbols based on these guesses.

The file $(ARCH)$(CLANG) in this directory is selected based on such
guesses and then prefixed to make files.

The file CMDS locates make commands in your environment.

The file config.in does the core generating of environment specific
settings based on all of this. It defines a few exceptions where
guesses are bad.

IF YOU CHOOSE NEW SETTINGS...

Edit the file DEFSITE or use command line parameters to configure, i.e.,
alternating variables and values such as
	configure TOPDIR /here ARCH sun4

Note that ...

-O is a bad option for compiling the cs MAIN_.c because some cc's crash
due to size. The main routine itself is relatively small. Some systems
even want a different compiler in this case. 

MAINFLAGS is used when the MAIN_.c of the sather compiler is
processed. This file has lots of symbols and requires special table
sizes on some *NIXes.  Since we include this header file, every make
file sees the defaults, can save them or append to them or replace
them.

BOOTFLAGS are only passed to the make step which compiles the boot
compiler and can be used to override flags in the make file that was
generated when the distribution was constructed on another machine:
compiler/cs.cs.boot$(CLANG).

IF YOU'RE PORTING...
 
If you port to a new architecture and configure does not select the
proper settings in the usual way, you may have to overwrite default
settings in config.in before the settings are written to file.
