# The configuration parameters are obtained from the command line,
# from files that you may edit and from the environment.
#
# First, this script uses the command line arguments to overwrite its
# local default settings of variables or default settings it obtains by
# executing other shells, in particular the file DEFSITE. So you may choose
# either to edit DEFSITE or to pass the corresponding values via the
# command line using the variable names in DEFSITE.
#
# The script records the settings obtained in this way in a file
# named config.${ENVI}. ENVI is a variable that characterizes the current
# architecture, operating system and compiler/library choice you make.
# config.${ENVI} will include the machine specific choice of compiler flags
# in the file ${ENVI} in this directory.
# 
# Finally, the script prefixes the file config.${ENVI} to all makefiles
# in the system.

( cd make ; 
 /bin/cat DEFSITE CMDS config.in > config.sh ;
 /bin/sh config.sh $* )
