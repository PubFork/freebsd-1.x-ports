This directory contains C files and object files used by the system in
compiling code.

GC: The garbage collector source files and documentation.
    from parcftp.xerox.com:pub/russell. 

README: This file.

all.h: Header file to be included in C files to be linked with Sather
   files. Defines the types `ptr', `bool', and `real'.

all_.h: Header file inluded by all C files generated by the Sather
   compiler. Defines C types and macros used in this code.

deep_save_.c, deep_save_.o: C code to support `deep_save' operations.
   These allow one to save and restore structures constructed from
   arbitrary objects in files. 

gc_.a: A library archive for the garbage collector. Only the used
   functionality will be linked into the Sather binary.

macros_.h: This file is included in Sather generated C files and
   defines a number of primitive operations via macros for efficiency.

main_.c, main_.o: A C main function which calls initialization
   routines and then the Sather main function.

precompiled: Directory with precompiled C source and object files for the
   base classes. These are generally used directly instead of being
   recompiled for each program. 

runtime_, runtime_.c, runtime_.o: Runtime routines used in each Sather
   program. 

tilde_expand_.c, tilde_expand_.o: For parsing file names.
