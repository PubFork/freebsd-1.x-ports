This package contains the binary release of Tcl, an embeddable tool command
language.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read the draft of my
upcoming book on Tcl and Tk, which can be retrieved using anonymous
FTP from the directory "ucb/tcl" on ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.  Part I of the
book provides an introduction to writing Tcl scripts and Part III
describes how to write C code that uses the Tcl C library procedures.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.
