               The Standard ML of New Jersey Library
                          (Version 0.2)

This is the second release of the Standard ML of New Jersey Library.
The changes from 0.1 are mostly bug fixes, although some structures
have additional operations, and there are a couple of new modules.
See the CHANGES file for details.

The SML/NJ Library is released as part of Standard ML of New Jersey,
and is under the same license (see the COPYRIGHT file).  It consists
of a collection of useful data structures (taken mostly from the
compiler), and various utilities (influenced by the UNIX libraries).
Currently, everything is collected in a single directory.  In addition
to the library source files, there are a following files:

    COPYRIGHT		- the copyright notice and license
    README		- this file
    BUG-LIST		- a list of reported bugs and their status
    lib-manual.ps	- the library manual, which consists of Unix
			  style manual pages for all of the modules
			  in the library.
    load-all		- an SML file that will load the entire library
			  using "use".
    library.dep		- a SourceGroups dependency file.
    lib-bug-form	- a sample format for library bug reports.
