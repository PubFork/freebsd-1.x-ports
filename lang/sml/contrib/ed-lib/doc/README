This directory contains the LaTeX source for the documentation
of the Edinburgh Standard ML Library.  This documentation is available
as technical report ECS-LFCS-91-148, from Dorothy Mackie, LFCS,
University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, Edinburgh, Scotland EH9 3JZ.
Dorothy's e-mail address is dam%ecsvax.ed.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk.
The report costs 5 pounds sterling or 10 US dollars.

The printed version of the report omits the entries for AsciiOrdString,
BoolVector, ByteVector, FULL_ORD, FULL_SEQ_ORD, LexOrdList and LexOrdString.
If you were wondering where the string comparisons were, this is where
to look!

The file news.tex documents the changes and additions to the specification
of the library since the technical report was printed.

To print this report, first run make_entries to generate the descriptions
of each entry from the signatures.  Then run LaTeX on the file main.tex.
The necessary style files are included.  Please note that the verbatim
style package is ditributed under a different copyright from the rest of
the library.  See the readme.mz4 files for details.
