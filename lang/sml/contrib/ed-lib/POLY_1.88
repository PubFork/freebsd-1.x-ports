The poly.dist directory contains an implementation of the
library for Poly/ML version 2.01.

To use it with version 1.88 of Poly/ML, cd to poly.dist,
delete Core/Vector.sml and change Core/Array.sml as directed
in that file.

To use the -poly_make option to INSTALL with version 1.88
of poly/ML, use INSTALL.88 instead of INSTALL.
