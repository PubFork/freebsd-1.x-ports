The nj-sml.dist directory contains an implementation of the
library for Standard ML of New Jersey version 0.74.

To use it with version 0.66 of SML/NJ, cd to nj-sml.dist,
move build_all.sml.66 to build_all.sml, delete Core/Vector.sml,
change Core/Array.sml as directed in that file, and change the
following lines in StreamPair.sml:

fun execute s =
	let val (i, os) = IO.execute(s, [])
	...

to:

fun execute s =
	let val (i, os) = IO.execute s
	...
