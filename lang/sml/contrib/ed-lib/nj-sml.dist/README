This directory contains an implementation of the Edinburgh
Standard ML Library for Standard ML of New Jersey 0.74.
It is more efficient than the portable version in that it
uses the built-in functions on strings, arrays, vectors and
bytearrays.

To use it with version 0.66 of SML/NJ, move build_all.sml.66
to build_all.sml, delete Core/Vector.sml, change Core/Array.sml
as instructed in that file, and change the following lines in
StreamPair.sml:

fun execute s =
	let val (i, os) = IO.execute(s, [])
	...

to:

fun execute s =
	let val (i, os) = IO.execute s
	...
