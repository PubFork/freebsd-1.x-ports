This directory contains an implementation of the Edinburgh
Standard ML Library for Poly/ML 2.01.  It is more efficient
than the portable version in that it uses the built-in
functions on arrays.  It also recognises the non-standard
functions that Poly/ML provides.

To use this code with version 1.88 of Poly/ML, delete
Core/Vector.sml and change Core/Array.sml as instructed in
that file.
