This directory, and its subdirectory lib, contain all that is necessary
to reconstruct the ml prettyprinter and prettyprinter generator
documented in doc.doc.

Files with extension .sml are mechanically derived from (not supplied)
literate programming files, but (in a pinch) can be edited.

The file mlkernel.mlg is fodder for  mllama -- an LALR parser generator
which I wrote in about 1983. I hope someone takes the trouble to
turn it into mlyacc fodder.

WARNING: The prettyprinter was written in a hurry; you may not agree
that it yields pretty-looking programs, and you certainly won't think
it pretty.
