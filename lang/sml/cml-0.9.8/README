This is the fifth release of Concurrent ML (CML).  It is available
free of charge under an X-windows style copyright (see the COPYRIGHT
file).  You need version 0.75 (or later) of SML/NJ to run this
release (we suggest getting the latest release 0.93)

Concurrent ML is a concurrent extension of Standard ML, supporting
dynamic thread creation, synchronous message passing on synchronous
channels, and first-class synchronous operations.  First-class
synchronous operations allow users to tailor their synchronization
abstractions for their application.  CML also supports both stream
I/O and low-level I/O in an integrated fashion.  CML is being used
in two large applications at Cornell: a multi-threaded interface to
the X-windows protocol, and a distributed implementation of the
Nuprl theorem proving environment.  Full details of the CML language
can be found in the CML manual, which includes a tutorial introduction
to the system.

We are eager to receive your comments, bug reports and constructive
criticism.  You can send electronic mail to

  sml-bugs@research.att.com

(the old address of cml-bugs@cs.cornell.edu will also work), or

CML is distributed as a compressed tar file available via anonymous
ftp from the following three sites:

    ftp.cs.cornell.edu in /pub
    research.att.com in /dist/ml
    princeton.edu in /pub/ml

SML/NJ is available from the latter two sites as well.  The distribution
includes source, examples and documentation.  To obtain the distribution,
connect to one of the above sites, use the login id "anonymous" and your
name as the password and go to the proper directory.  There you will find
the file

  CML-0.9.8.tar.Z    -- the complete distribution (including manual)

Which you shoule copy (remember to switch to binary mode before copying the
file).  Here is a sample ftp dialog:

  % ftp ftp.cs.cornell.edu
  Name: anonymous
  Password: <your-name@your-machine>
  ftp> cd pub
  ftp> binary
  ftp> get CML-0.9.8.tar.Z
  ftp> quit

After you have transferred the file, you can install the distribution
directory tree by the command

  % zcat CML-0.9.8.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

This creates the following directory tree below your current directory:

  cml-0.9.8/src       -- the CML source
  cml-0.9.8/library   -- source for library modules
  cml-0.9.8/doc       -- the CML documentation
  cml-0.9.8/examples  -- source for most of the examples in the manual

The CML manual contains instructions for installing and running CML.
