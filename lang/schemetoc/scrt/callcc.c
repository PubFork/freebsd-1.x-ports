/* The following procedures implement CALL-WITH-CURRENT-CONTINUATION.
   CALLCCCONTINUING is the function that is executed when a continuation is
   applied.  It is called with the result to be returned and the procedure's
   closure which is the continuation created by the initial call to
   TSC_CALLWITHCURRENTCONTINUATION.  It will unwind the stack until the right
   return point is found.  If it is not found, then it will restore the stack
   from the continuation(s).  Once the stack is known to have the right
   contents, it will restore the correct state with longjmp.
