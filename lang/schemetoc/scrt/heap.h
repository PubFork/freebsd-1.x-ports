/* This module implements the object storage storage system for SCHEME->C.

   Unlike most Lisp systems, it is not intended that SCHEME->C provide a
   "one language" environment divorced from other programming languages.
   Instead, it is intended that SCHEME->C co-exist with other languages
   and share their development tools and runtime environment.

   Nor, is it intended that SCHEME->C have detailed knowledge and intimate
   control over the hardware.  Instead of generating actual instructions,
   it generates C intermediate language.

   By adhering to these two design goals, SCHEME->C can be a powerful tool
   for delivering Lisp based technology to non-Lisp environments.  However,
   these design goals also place some significant constraints on the design
   of the storage system.  For example:

   1.  The system must tolerate both Scheme and non-Scheme storage and
       data types.

   2.  The system will not have any control over register allocation or
       instruction sequences.

   3.  In examining register or stack contents, one can make a statement that
       something is not a pointer, but one cannot say that something is a
       pointer.  At best, one can say that it looks exactly like a pointer.

   Given these constraints, a conventional "stop-and-copy" garbage collector
   cannot be used.  Instead, a storage allocation method called
   "mostly-copying" is used (see WRL Research Report 88/2, Compacting Garbage
   Collection with Ambiguous Roots).

   In its simplist form, the algorithm works as follows.  The heap is divided
   into pages (which need not be the same size as the processor's page).
   Objects are allocated entirely within a page, or in a dedicated set of
   pages.  When half the storage in the heap has been allocated, the garbage
   collector is invoked.

   Garbage collection is divided into three phases.  The first is the a copy
   phase similar to that of the Minsky-Fenichel-Yochelson-Chaeny-Arnborg
   collector.  Items will be copied from the oldspace (pages in the current
   generation) to the newspace (pages in the next generation).  Indirect
   pointers to new objects will be placed in the old objects, but pointers
   to new objects are never stored in new objects.
   
   During this phase, the contents of continuations (including the current
   continuation which is in the registers and the stack) get special
   processing.  Each word in them is examined to see if it might be a pointer.
   If it is a pointer, then the object that it points to is copied, and the
   page is marked as locked.

   Thus at the end of the phase, all accessibile storage has been copied, and
   all pointers are indirect through the old space.  All pages which have items
   which must be left in place are marked as locked.

   The next phase is the correction phase which turns all indirect pointers
   into their correct values.  At the end of this phase, all pointers will
   point to the correct place, but items which were locked will be located in
   the newspace.

   The final phase is the copy back phase where items that are locked are
   copied back from the newspace to their correct position in the locked
   pages.  At this time, locked pages are unlocked and promoted to newspace.

   At this point, garbage collection is done and the generation number is
   advanced.  As with the classical "stop-and-copy" algorithm, the time used
   is proportional to the amount of storage retained, rather than the total
   amount of storage.  It needs somewhat more storage as it must retain locked
   pages, and has duplicate copies of items of locked pages.

   In order to avoid repeated copying of retained data, the collector
   implements a generational version of the algorithm.  Objects that survive
   a collection are retained and not moved until more than SCLIMIT of the heap
   is allocated following a collection.  At this point, the entire heap is
   collected (see WRL Technical Note TN-12, Mostly-Copying Garbage Collection
   Picks Up Generations and C++).

   A few simple changes to the previously described algorithm result in a
   generational collector.  Even generation numbers represent retained storage
   and storage is always allocated out of an odd numbered generation when the
   user program is executing.  During garbage collection, all retained
   objects in the odd generation are copied into a new even numbered space.
   During this copy phase, pointers into an object in an even numbered space
   need not be followed.  A total collection is done by changing the space
   number on all even numbered pages to the current odd generation and then
   doing a collection.

   In order for a generational scheme to work, all stores of pointers to new
   objects in old pages must be detected.  This is done by explicit checks
   in:  SET-CAR!, SET-CDR!, VECTOR-SET!, SET!, SET-TOP-LEVEL-VALUE!, PUTPROP,
   and SCHEME-TSCP-SET!.  While at first glance, explicit checks seem a slow
   way of doing things, the reduction in copying more than makes up for them.

   The garbage collector may be configured by the user setting any of the
   following environment variables:

	name:	 range:		default:	action:

   	SCHEAP	 [1:1000]	4		Number of megabytes to
						initially allocate for the heap
						(total).

	SCMAXHEAP [SCHEAP:1000]	heap*5		Number of megabytes to allow
						the heap to grow to.

	SCLIMIT	 [10:45]	40		Cause of total collection of
						the heap when more than this %
						of the heap is allocated
						following a generational
						collection.

	SCGCINFO [0:2]		0		C boolean indicating that
						garbage collection statistics
						should be printed on stderr.

						When set to 2, additional
						debugging information is
						printed and additional tests
						are done.

   Default settings (SCHEAP and SCMAXHEAP may already be defined in options.h)

			user's program.  A zero value indicates that the page
			is not available for garbage collection.

	PAGETYPE	tag field indicating the type of data stored in the
			page.  It is either PAIRTAG, EXTENDEDTAG, or
			BIGEXTENDEDTAG.

	PAGELOCK	boolean indicating whether or not the page is locked
			by the garbage collector.

	PAGELINK	next page (or -1) of the lock list whose head is
			kept in LOCKLIST, and length in LOCKCNT (only during
			gc).
				-or-
			OKTOSET or ~OKTOSET (-1 or 0) indicating status of
			a just allocated page (value of INITIALLINK).
				-or-
			next page (or -1) of the GENLIST, whose head is
			kept in GENLIST.  This list contains all pages in older
			generations that might contain a pointer to a newer
			generation.

			If this value is non-zero, then it is possible to set
			pointers in the page without going through
			sc_setgeneration.

   Objects which are longer than one page are allocated on an integral number
   of pages.  Pages other than the head are marked with a BIGEXTENDEDTAG in
   pagetype field to indicate that they are related to the previous page.

   CURRENT_GENERATION holds the generation number that is presently being
   allocated.  NEXT_GENERATION holds the obvious during garbage collection.

   N.B.:  There may be pages in the range 1 through sc_heappages that are
	  not managed by the garbage collector.  This is why the 0 flag is
	  used in PAGEGENERATION.
