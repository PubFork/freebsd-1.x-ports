The Post Office Protocol server runs on a variety of Unix[1] computers
to manage electronic mail for Macintosh and MS-DOS computers.  The
server was developed at the University of California at Berkeley and
conforms fully to the specifications in RFC 1081[2] and RFC 1082[3].
The Berkeley server also has extensions to send electronic mail on
behalf of a client.
