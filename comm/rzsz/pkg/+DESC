Rz and sz are Unix programs designed to support dial-in XMODEM,
YMODEM, and ZMODEM transfers via the controlling TTY port.

The contents of this archive can be uploaded to a remote Unix or
Xenix system by ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied
zupl.t script.  Connect to your Unix/Xenix system, select an
empty directory, and then give the YAM/ZCOMM command: "source
zupl.t".  This will upload minirb.c, compile it, and then use
minirb to bootstrap upload the rz/sz files.
