This version of rz/sz has been modified to work correctly with tip and
other communications programs that run external protocols.
To build:
$ make
$ su root
$ make install

N.B.: This version of rz/sz is not freely usable software and its licensing
restrictions stand against the philosophy espoused by FreeBSD.  While it
is provided as a service to FreeBSD users, we discourage its use and
recommend using kermit instead.  The file `./readme' contains licensing
information.
