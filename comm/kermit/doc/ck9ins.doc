You can obtain C-Kermit from Columbia University via network (Internet or
BITNET/EARN) or by mail order on DOS-format diskette or magnetic tape.
To read DOS-format disks, you need DOS-diskette reading software, which can
be obtained from Microware (the maker of OS-9 itself) or various public domain
utilities that are available free of charge.

To build C-Kermit for OS-9, collect all the C-Kermit source files into a
directory:

  ckc*.c, ckc*.h, cku*.c, cku*.h, ckwart.c, ckcpro.w, ck9*.*

There are two makefiles: ck9ker.mak and ck9ker.gcc.  If you have a running
version of the GNU C compiler, use ck9ker.gcc (it produces smaller, more
efficient code); otherwise use ck9ker.mak which uses the standard OS-9/68k C
compiler.  Read the appropropriate makefile, edit the necessary changes
mentioned there, create the subdirectories, and make the new Kermit by typing:

  make -f=ck9ker.mak

or:

  make -f=ck9ker.gcc

By default, this produces an executable C-Kermit file called wermit.  Check
to make sure it runs, then rename it to kermit and put it in the directory you
normally use for programs, such as /h0/cmds, /dd/cmds, or /h5/cmds, or in
any directory in your OS-9 PATH.

Put your CKERMIT.INI, CKERMOD.INI, CKERMIT.KDD, and CKERMIT.KSD files (if
any) in your home directory.
