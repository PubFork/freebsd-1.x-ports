    1 Product Description
    
    
    Kermit is a file transfer and terminal emulation program that was
    developed by Columbia University in 1981.  It runs on a wide variety of
    operating systems and is available to the public free of charge.
    
    Kermit's major features include advanced and efficient Kermit file
    transfer, terminal connection, support for asynchronous connections
    (either direct or via modems) and TCP/IP connections, a built-in DIAL
    command supporting a wide variety of modems, extensive support for
    national and international Roman, Cyrillic, and Japanese character
    sets, and a powerful, easy-to-use script programming language for
    automated operation.
    
    C-Kermit is the name used to describe the version of Kermit software
    (written in the "C" programming language) that runs on most UNIX
    implementations, DEC VAXes running VMS, NEXT workstations, OS/2, the
    Commodore Amiga, the Atari ST, OS-9, and now Data General AOS/VS.
    
    Revision 5.188 of C-Kermit for AOS/VS is based on release 5A(188) of
    C-Kermit. 
    
    DISCLAIMER
    
    The C-Kermit software is provided in source code form by the Kermit
    Distribution Center at Columbia University.  The software is provided
    "as is;" no other warranty is provided, express or implied, including
    without limitations, any implied warranty of merchantability or implied
    warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
    
    Neither Data General nor Columbia University warrant C-Kermit for
    AOS/VS software or documentation in any way.  In addition, neither the
    authors of any Kermit programs, publications or documentation, nor
    Columbia University nor any contributing institutions or individuals

                                                                     3
    
    
    2 Prerequisites
    
    
    To run C-Kermit for AOS/VS Rev 5.188, you need a Data General MV-series
    computer running AOS/VS revision 7.69 or later (DGC Model 3900 or
    31133), or AOS/VS II revision 2.20 or later (DGC Model 31585).
    (Earlier revisions may work, but have not been tested with C-Kermit for
    AOS/VS.)
    
    To run C-Kermit for AOS/VS over a serial connection, you also need a
    line into a port on an intelligent asynchronous controller (DGC IAC or
    equivalent) on the MV.  This line may be directly connected to another
    computer (e.g, a PC) via a null modem cable/adaptor, or it may be
    connected to a telephone line via a modem or a modem elimator.
    
    To use C-Kermit for AOS/VS over an INCOMING TCP/IP connection, a
    working TCP/IP connection is required.  This connection may be provided
    either by AOS/VS TCP/IP (DGC Model 30997) or by AOS/VS II TCP/IP (DGC
    Model 31758).  Refer to the release notices for those products for
    specific requirements.
    
    To use C-Kermit for AOS/VS over an OUTGOING TCP/IP connection, a
    working implementation of AOS/VS II TCP/IP, revision 1.10 or later, is
    required.
    
    For specific information about the software and hardware requirements
    for TCP/IP connections, refer to the AOS/VS TCP/IP or AOS/VS II TCP/IP
    release notices.
    
    
                                                                     4
    
    
    3 Enhancements
    
    
    The previous version of Kermit for AOS/VS, whose revision number (as
    obtained via the CLI REVISION command) corresponded to the revision of
    the "C" compiler with which it was linked, was based on Columbia
    University's C-Kermit version 4D(61), ported to AOS/VS in 1986.
    
    Since that time, there have been a number of enhancements to C-Kermit
    which are now included in C-Kermit for AOS/VS, including:
    
         *    support for Kermit connections over TCP/IP connections
    
         *    character set translations
    
         *    an extensive script programming language
    
         *    ability to specify what action Kermit should take when a
              filename collision occurs during file transfer
    
         *    support for sliding windows and variable packet sizes
    
         *    support for additional file attributes (e.g., "creation" date
              and time)
    
    
    
                                                                     5
    
    
    4 Notes and Warnings
    
    
      4.1 Known Problems
    
         1.   Abnormal terminations may occasionally occur on expiration of
              certain timers (when, for instance, the local Kermit gets no
              response from the remote Kermit).
    
    
      4.2 Restrictions
    
         1.   The MAIL command has not been implemented
    
         2.   The BYE command has not been implemented.
    
         3.   It is not possible to SUSPEND C-Kermit for AOS/VS sessions.
    
         4.   The WHO command does not accept arguments.
    
         5.   When C-Kermit for AOS/VS is receiving a file, and the file
              collision action is set to "update" (meaning that the
              incoming file should overwrite the existing file only if its
              "creation" date is more recent) and the incoming file is in
              fact newer, the modification date on the resulting file will
              actually be the date/time of the transfer (the real last
              modification date/time).  This can cause succeeding "update"
              operations to fail.
    
         6.   Local Kermit commands that are implemented through CLI calls
              (WHO, DIR, etc.) cannot be interrupted except by entering BRK
              (CMD-BRK on a DG terminal) followed by ^C^A or, as a last
              resort, ^C^B.  (The remote versions can be interrupted with
              ^C.)
    
         7.   C-Kermit for AOS/VS cannot determine the status of modem
              signals on a line.
    
         8.   C-Kermit for AOS/VS makes no attempt to determine, at
              runtime, whether AOS/VS II TCP/IP is running.  Thus, if you
              attempt to make a connection over a TCP/IP stack when AOS/VS
              II TCP/IP is NOT running, there will be a wait until the
              request times out.
    
         9.   The user must ensure that the XLT characteristic on his
              terminal device is turned OFF, prior to starting C-Kermit for
              AOS/VS:
    
                   ) CHAR/OFF/XLT

        10.   In some environments, it may be necessary to turn the 8BT 
              characteristic ON, prior to starting C-Kermit for AOS/VS,
              in order to transfer binary files:

                   ) CHAR/ON/8BT
    
    
                                                                     6
    
    
      4.3 Notes
    
         1.   When C-Kermit for AOS/VS is receiving a file whose name is
              the same as an existing file, and the file collision action
              is "backup" or "rename", the file that is renamed will have a
              .<number> extension, rather than a ~<number>~ extension.
    
         2.   When C-Kermit for AOS/VS is sending a file, question marks
              (?) and dollar signs ($) in the filename will be converted to
              upper-case X's.
    
         3.   When C-Kermit for AOS/VS is receiving a file, hyphens (-)
              will be converted to underscores (_).
    
         4.   C-Kermit for AOS/VS uses the last modification date/time
              rather than the creation date/time in all file transfer
              operations.

	 5.   C-Kermit for AOS/VS mandates that source files (for file
              transfers) reside in the current working directory, unless
              a pathname is specified.

    6 Product Organization
    
    
    This section describes the C-Kermit for AOS/VS software release
    organization.
    
    
    6.1 File Listing
    
    The media distribution format for C-Kermit for AOS/VS is a disk file in
    AOS/VS DUMP format.  The files that are included with the dumpfile are:
    
         CKERMIT.INI         - the standard C-Kermit initialization file
	 CKERMOD.INI.PROTO   - the tailorable initialization file
         KERMIT.CLI.PROTO    - a sample macro for starting Kermit
                             - (a.k.a. "ckdker.cli")
         KERMIT.RN           - the Kermit release notice (this file)
                             - (a.k.a. "ckdins.doc")
         KERMIT.PR           - the Kermit executable image
         KERMIT.ST           - the Kermit symbol table file
    
    
    6.2 Obtaining the Software from Columbia University
    
    The C-Kermit for AOS/VS software is available over the Internet from
    Columbia University, via "anonymous FTP" access to the following
    system:
    
         watsun.cc.columbia.edu        128.59.39.2
    
    There are two versions of the software available on watsun.  The first
    is the AOS/VS dumpfile itself, which must be transferred to your system
    using binary mode.  Its path on watsun is:
    
         kermit/b/ckdker.df
    
    
                                                                     9
    
    
    Alternatively, you may retrieve the dumpfile in uuencode format, which
    may be transferred over 7-bit connections where binary mode is not
    available.  In this case you must also retrieve the source code for the
    uuencode program (called ckdecod.c).  The pathname on watsun for these
    files is:
    
         kermit/b/ckdker.uue
         kermit/b/ckdecod.c
    
    Once you have compiled and linked ckdecod on your system, you must use
    the resulting executable (ckdecod.pr) to transform ckdker.uue into
    ckdker.df:
    
         ) XEQ CKDECOD CKDKER.UUE
    
    You should move the resulting file, CKDKER.DF to :UTIL, then follow the
    installation instructions later in this notice.
    
    
                                                                     10
    
    
    6.3 Obtaining the Software from a PC Diskette
    
    C-Kermit for AOS/VS is available, in dump file format, with the
    diskette that comes with the "Using C-Kermit..." book described in the
    documentation section of this release notice.  The diskette includes
    both CKDKER.DF and CKDKER.RN (this file).
    
    There are a variety of methods available for transferring the software
    from the diskette to the target MV.  All of them involve a PC.  Those
    methods that are Data General-specific are described briefly here.
    
    Note that in all of these descriptions, the C-Kermit diskette is
    assumed to be in drive A of the PC.
    
    If CEO Connection is running on both your PC and the target MV, follow
    these instructions:
    
            1. Establish a session with the MV system, which can
               be accomplished by choosing #6 (Utilities) from the
               CEO Connection main menu on the PC, then #1 (Log on)
               from the utilities menu.
            2. Choose #4 (Send a file) from the main menu.
            3. When prompted for the MS-DOS pathname, enter
                 a:\ckdker.df
            4. Then specify where the file should be stored
               on the MV.  If you have the proper access privileges,
               store it in :UTIL.  Otherwise, store it in your
               home directory (:UDD:<your username>:CKDKER.DF),
               and then have the MV system manager install it for you.
    
    If your PC is active in a PC*I network (which consists of WTS and the
    Microsoft MS-NET Redirector software on the PC, and the MV Server for
    MS-NET software on the MV), follow these instructions (which assume
    that drive E on your PC is redirected to the MV disk):
    
            1. Establish your redirected drive by issuing the
               appropriate "net use" command.
            2. Change your working directory to a:
                 C:\> a:
            3. Copy the C-Kermit for AOS/VS dumpfile from drive A
               to drive E:
                 A:\> copy ckdker.df e:
            4. Where ckdker.df ends up on the MV will depend on
               the PC*I configuration there.  Contact the MV
               system manager to locate it and install it.
    
    
                                                                     11
    
    
    Finally, if your PC and the MV participate in a Novell Netware network,
    follow these instructions (which assume that drive F on the PC is
    redirected to the MV):
    
            1. Establish your redirected drive by issuing the
               appropriate map command.
            2. Change your working directory to a:
                 C:\> a:
            3. Copy the C-Kermit for AOS/VS dumpfile from drive A
               to drive F:
                 A:\> copy ckdker.df f:
            4. Where ckdker.df ends up on the MV will depend on the
               Netware configuration there.  Contact the MV system
               manager to locate it and install it.
    
    Once the dumpfile has been transferred to the MV, follow the
    installation instructions in Section 7.2 ("Installing the Software").
    
    
                                                                     12
    
    
    7 Installation Instructions
    
    
    This section describes procedures for establishing a communications
    line to use with C-Kermit for AOS/VS and for installing the Kermit
    software.
    
    
    7.1 Establishing a Communications Line
    
    
    7.1.1 Serial Connections
    
    If you have not already established a communications line, you must
    connect your modem or direct connect line to a port on your intelligent
    asynchronous controller, and then describe the line to AOS/VS.  This
    involves a physical line connection as well as running the appropriate
    software (VSGEN) to define the line for use by AOS/VS.  These
    instructions assume that the line has already been defined via VSGEN.
    
    There are two ways to establish an asynch connection:
    
         *    modem connect -- a line connecting a computer to a modem
              which in turn connects to another modem and computer via a
              phone line
    
         *    direct connect -- a line connecting one computer to

    For modem connections, an RS-232 modem cable (with pin 2 on one end
    wired to pin 2 on the other end, pin 3 to pin 3, etc.) should be used
    to connect the modem to the port on the aysynch controller.  The modem
    configuration itself is beyond the scope of this release notice, but an
    example configuration using a Hayes Smartmodem 1200 is given below.
    (Note that even if your modem is Hayes-compatible, you may still need
    to adjust these settings for your configuration.)  See your modem
    manual for details about your modem.
    
    
                                                                     13
    
    
    Switch  Position  Effect
    ------  --------  ------
      1      DOWN     Normal DTR operation
      2       UP      Result codes are in English
      3      DOWN     Result codes are sent
      4       UP      Modem echoes commands
      5       UP      Enable auto-answer
      6       UP      Force Carrier Detect true (outgoing lines only)
      7       UP      Single-line RJ11 installation
      8      DOWN     Enables command recognition
    
    In particular, certain controllers that support modem signals (older
    IAC/8's, for example) require the presence of Carrier Detect in order
    to receive data from the modem, and Clear to Send in order to send data
    to the modem.  On these lines, Carrier Detect must be strapped high on
    the modem itself.  (Clear to Send will normally be supplied by the
    modem by default.)
    
    On newer controllers, it is possible to override the requirement for
    CTS with the /MDUA characteristics option, and the requirement for CD
    with the /SMCD characteristics option.  Consult your hardware reference
    manuals, or contact your Data General service representative, for
    particulars on your controller.
    
    Some other points to remember include:
    
         *    In general, AOS/VS support for a particular modem line is
              restricted to either incoming accesss or outgoing access, but
              not both.
    
         *    In general, a given modem can only talk to another modem that
              supports the same communications parameters.  For example, a
              1200 bps modem can only communicate with anther modem that
              supports the same 1200 bps protocol.
    
    
    
                                                                     14
    
    
    As an alternative to using two modems, if the two computers you wish to
    connect are not more than 50 feet (or thereabouts) from one another,
    you can use an RS-232 null modem cable with the following pin-outs:
    
    Host      Target     Signal
    ----      ------     ------
    
       1------1          FG--frame ground

    |            |
    |-22      22-|       RI--ring indicator
    
    
    Under AOS/VS, most communications parameters must be specified with the
    VSGEN program or the CLI CHARACTERISTICS command.  These parameters
    include the baud rate, the number of data bits, and the parity.
    
    Certain parameters are limited by the hardware.  For example, if you
    have a 1200 bps modem, you should not specify a 2400 baud line through
    the CLI CHARACTERISTICS command (or the Kermit SET SPEED command).
    Under AOS/VS, a modem line must be either originate or answer.
    Incoming modem lines must be under EXEC control; outgoing modem lines
    must not.
    
    
                                                                     15
    
    
    The following characteristics settings are recommended for modem lines
    being used with C-Kermit for AOS/VS:
    
    Signal              VSGEN     CHARACTERISTICS     Setting
    ------              -----     ---------------     -------
    Flow Control        ?MIFC     IFC                 OFF
                        ?MOFC     OFC                 OFF
    Modem               ?MMOD     MOD                 ON for incoming line
                                                      OFF for outgoing line
    Parity              ?PAR0     PARITY              NONE
    Data Bits           ?COD3     CHARLEN             8
    Stop Bits           ?STP0     STOPBITS            1
    
    Normally, the characteristics on a typical Data General console line
    are set to something like this:
    
         ) CHAR
         /605X/LPP=24/CPL=80/BREAK=BMOB/TCC=40000/TCD=5000/TDW=1000/
         THC=2000/TLT=2000/CONTYPE=DIRECT
         /ON/ST/EB0/ULC/WRP
         /OFF/SFF/EPI/8BT/SPO/RAF/RAT/RAC/NAS/OTT/EOL/UCO/MRI/FF/EB1/PM/
         NRM/MOD/TO//ESC/FKT/HOFC/SHR/OFC/IFC/16B/ACC/SRDS/XLT/AUTOBAUD/
         CALLOUT/MDUA/HDPX/SMCD/RTSCD/HIFC/G1G0/DKHW/NLX
    
    The CHARACTERISTICS command can be used to modify the characterics
    settings so that they are suitable for use with a modem line.
    
    If you will be using a modem to dial OUT from an AOS/VS or AOS/VS II
    system, the console line to which the modem is attached must first be
    disabled from EXEC.  This should be accomplished by the system manager,
    using the following command:
    
         ) CONTROL @EXEC DISABLE @CONnnn
    
    where nnn is a decimal number with one, two, or three digits (e.g.,
    @CON2).
    
    The system manager may also need to modify the default characteristics
    on the modem line.  In general, the characteristics should be set as
    follows (assuming a full-duplex modem):
    
         ) CHAR/DEF/PARITY=NONE/CHARLEN=8/STOPBITS=1/BAUD=xxxx/ON/
         ST/EB0/ULC/WRP/OFF/OFC/IFC/HOFC/HIFC @CONnnn
    
    
                                                                     16
    
    
    Some of these characteristics are described below.  For information on
    all the options available with the CLI CHARACTERISTICS command, issue a
    "HELP/V CHARACTERISTICS" command at the CLI prompt.
    
    CALLOUT        If on, allows host-initiated calls, if they are allowed
                   by the controller.
    
    CHARLEN=x      Specifies the number of bits per character, including
                   stop bits.
    
    HIFC           If off, disables the use of hardware (RTS/CTS) input
                   flow control between the modem and the operating system.
    
    HOFC           If off, disables the use of hardware (RTS/CTS) output
                   flow control between the modem and the operating system.
    
    IFC            If off, disables the use of software (XON/XOFF) input
                   flow control between the modem and the operating system.
    
    OFC            If off, disables the use of software (XON/XOFF) output
                   flow control between the modem and the operating system.
    
    MDUA           If on, allows ?WRITE system calls to be issued on the
                   line, prior to establishment of a connection with a
                   remote modem.  Has no effect unless MOD is also on.
    
    MOD            If on, specifies that a modem interface is in use on
                   this line.  Use of MOD may only be specified on lines
                   that support modem signals (e.g., lines on IAC/8's).
                   When specified, the system will 1) disconnect the line
                   when loss of carrier is detected, 2) limit the amount of
                   time a user has to log in, 3) require that users logging
                   in over this line have modem privileges (as specified
                   through PREDITOR), 4) require that the modem assert
                   Clear to Send (CTS) before allowing writes to be issued
                   on the line, and 5) require the presence of Carrier
                   Detect before allowing writes to be issued on the line
                   (unless /SMCD is also on).
    
    PARITY=xxxx    Sets the parity for the line to the specified value,
                   which may be ODD, EVEN, or NONE.
    
    STOPBITS=x     Specifies the number of stop bits.
    
    
                                                                     17
    
    
    If you will be using a modem to dial IN to an AOS/VS or AOS/VS II
    system, the console line to which the modem is attached must be enabled
    by EXEC.  The system manager should enable the line with the following
    command:
    
         ) CONTROL @EXEC ENABLE @CONnnn
    
    where nnn is a decimal number with one, two, or three digits (e.g.,
    @CON2).
    
    The system manager may also need to modify the default characteristics
    for the line.  The default characteristics will take effect the next
    time the line is opened.  In general, the characteristics should be
    modified as follows (for use with a full-duplex modem):
    
         ) CHAR/DEF/PARITY=NONE/CHARLEN=8/STOPBITS=1/BAUD=xxxx/ON/MOD/
         ST/EB0/WRP/ULC/OFF/IFC/OFC/HIFC/HOFC @CONnnn
    
    Descriptions of other characteristics options that you may find useful
    for modem lines are listed below.  For a full listing, issue a "HELP/V
    CHARACTERISTICS" command at the CLI prompt.
    
    AUTOBAUD       If on, specifies that the system should automatically
                   determine the speed associated with the incoming call
                   (in which case the remote user must press the NEW LINE
                   or ENTER key three times, once the modems have
                   connected, so that the system may determine the speed of
                   the terminal).
    
    SMCD           If on, directs the system to ignore Carrier Detect on
                   modem-controlled lines.  This characteristic is only
                   valid on lines where MOD is set to on.
    
    
                                                                     18
    
    
    TCC=xxxx       On a modem line, the number of milliseconds the system
                   will wait for a carrier detect (CD) signal.
    
    TCD=xxxx       On a modem line, the number of milliseconds the system
                   will tolerate loss of carrier detect.
    
    TDW=xxxx       On a modem line, the number of milliseconds after a
                   modem connection that the system will wait before
                   attempting I/O to the line.
    
    THC=xxxx       On a modem line, the number of milliseconds after a
                   modem disconnect that the system will wait for the modem
                   to settle.
    
    
                                                                     19
    
    
    7.1.2 TCP/IP Connections
    
    C-Kermit for AOS/VS may be used to establish connections over existing
    TCP/IP networks.  Installing TCP/IP is beyond the scope of this release
    notice, so see the relevent TCP/IP documentation for more information.
    
    Once TCP/IP is installed and running, there are no particular
    Kermit-specific installation requirements.  An outgoing Kermit
    connection can be established by using the Kermit "telnet <host>"
    command, where <host> may be either a hostname found in the :etc:hosts
    file, or an Internet address in standard "dot" notation.  This method
    of establishing a TCP/IP connection with Kermit causes the Telnet port
    (23) to be used on the connection.
    
    Alternatively, other ports may be specified using the format "telnet
    <host>:<port number>".
    
    Note that outgoing TCP/IP connections can only be initiated with AOS/VS
    II TCP/IP.
    
    
                                                                     20
    
    
    7.2 Installing the Software
    
    Once you've retrieved the software, follow these instructions (which
    assume that the Kermit dump file is located in :UTIL) to load it onto
    your AOS/VS system:
    
         ) SUPERUSER ON
    
         ) DIR :UTIL
    
         ) CREATE/DIR KERMIT
    
         ) DIR KERMIT
    
         ) LOAD/V :UTIL:CKDKER.DF
    
    If you are installing C-Kermit for AOS/VS for public access, it is
    recommended that you copy the following files into :UTIL:
    
         ) COPY/V :UTIL:CKERMIT.INI CKERMIT.INI
    
	 ) COPY/V :UTIL:CKERMOD.INI CKERMOD.INI.PROTO

         ) COPY/V :UTIL:KERMIT.CLI KERMIT.CLI.PROTO

    CKERMIT.INI is the standardized C-Kermit initialization file.  It should
    not be edited.  Instead, individual users should copy CKERMOD.INI into
    their home directories, then use an editor such as SED to make any
    changes they desire.

    KERMIT.CLI may be modified to suit your site's requirements.

    Now create the following link in :UTIL: 
    
         ) CREATE/LINK KERMIT.PR :UTIL:KERMIT:KERMIT.PR
    
    The installation of C-Kermit for AOS/VS is now complete.
    
    
                                                                     21
    
    
    8 User Notes
    
    If you are accessing the Data General AOS/VS system via an incoming
    connection, some changes via the CHARACTERISTICS command may be
    required, depending on your terminal type.
    
    If you are accessing the Data General system using Kermit on a PC, you
    should use the d463 terminal emulator, which will allow you to emulate
    a native Data General terminal.  The default characteristics for the
    line should be adequate in that event.
    
    If, on the other hand, you are not using a Data General terminal or
    terminal emulator, then your next best bet is to use a VT220 or VT320
    emulator.  When you log in with a VTxxx emulator, you may notice that
    certain keys don't operate as expected -- for example, the backspace
    and ENTER keys.  In this case, you should issue the following command
    once you have logged in:
    
         ) CHAR/ON/NAS/XLT
    
    Here are brief descriptions of the NAS and XLT characteristics:
    
    NAS            If on, specifies a non-ANSI standard terminal.  On
                   input, this causes a carriage return to be converted to
                   a carriage return and a line feed, and a line feed to be
                   converted to a carriage return.  On output, it causes a
                   line feed to be converted to a carriage return and a
                   line feed.
    
    XLT            If on, enables support for the VT100-compatible family
                   of terminals.  (Support for VT100-compatible terminals
                   must have been specified by the system manager in
                   advance during system generation.  If you turn XLT on,
                   but still have problems with the backspace key, check
                   this with the system manager.)
    
    NOTE:  The XLT characteristic must be OFF before C-Kermit for AOS/VS is
    used to perform file transfers.
    
    In order to use international character sets, you must issue the
    following command:
    
         ) CHAR/ON/8BT
    
    where 8BT impacts the line as follows:
    
    8BT            If on, causes all 8 bits of a character to be treated as
                   data.
    
    
                                                                     22
    
    
    These changes to your console's characteristics via the CHARACTERISTICS
    command will only be in effect for the current session.  To have them
    take effect in all of your terminal sessions, you can include the
    CHARACTERISTICS command that sets them to the desired values in your
    LOGON.CLI macro (or equivalent).  Check with your system manager for
    more information.
    
    The name of the Kermit executable image is KERMIT.PR.  To see if it
    exists on your system, issue the following command:
    
         ) PATHNAME KERMIT.PR
    
    If the system returns an indication that it found KERMIT.PR, then you
    should check the revision number on it by issuing a REVISION command:
    
         ) REV/V KERMIT.PR
    
    The revision should be 00.05.188.00, or greater.  If it is not, it is
    an older revision of AOS/VS Kermit, and may not have the capabilities
    associated with other implementations of C-Kermit.
    
    If Kermit does not appear to exist on your system, or has an earlier
    revision number than 00.05.188.00, check with the system manager.
    Otherwise, check to see if the KERMIT.CLI macro exists:
    
         ) PATHNAME KERMIT.CLI
    
    You can use this macro to start AOS/VS Kermit:
    
         ) KERMIT

    If your system does not have a KERMIT.CLI macro, you can start 
    KERMIT.PR directly by typing:
    
         ) X KERMIT

    
    
                                                                     23
    
    
    AOS/VS Kermit uses an initialization file called CKERMIT.INI.  There
    should be a copy on your system in :UTIL.  If there is, you can simply
    use that rather than creating a copy in your :UDD directory.  (The 
    KERMIT.CLI macro will check to see if there is a CKERMIT.INI in your 
    :UDD directory.  If there is, it will use that as your initialization 
    file; otherwise, it will look in :UTIL.)

    CKERMIT.INI causes various initialization steps to be performed when
    Kermit starts up.  Normally, CKERMIT.INI should not be modified.
    Instead, if there are changes you wish to make in the initialization
    procedure, you can create your own CKERMOD.INI in your home directory,
    using SED or another text editor.  There should be a sample version
    of CKERMOD.INI in :UTIL that you can use as a template.  (For
    information on using SED, enter X SED <filename> to start it up; 
    once you are in, you can issue the HELP command for instructions 
    on how to use it.)
