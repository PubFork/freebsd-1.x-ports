It's easy to setup an email to fax gateway with these simple steps:

Step 1.  Setup the FlexFAX software as usual.

Step 2.  Edit your sendmail configuration.  Include the following
mailer definition (or similar):

Mfax,	P=/usr/local/lib/fax/mailfax, F=DFMhu, M=100000,
	A=mailfax $u $h $f

and add the following address rewriting rule to rule set 0:

# forward FAX messages to FlexFAX software
R$+<@$+.FAX>		$#fax $@ $2 $: $1		user@host.FAX

Step 3.  Create a mailfax shell script that formats the mail and
submits the result for transmission.  A simple one is:

#! /bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/faxmail | /usr/local/bin/sendfax -n -d "$1@$2" -f "$3"

Note that the mailfax script must be invoked as either root, daemon, or
uucp if the from address is to be changed with the -f option to sendfax.
This is typically the case when sendmail invokes a mailer program and
the from address identity is different that of the real uid.

Step 4.  Restart sendmail, refreeze your configuration, or whatever is
necessary to cause the configuration changes to be seen by the system.


Voila!  Now mail to user@dest.fax will get formatted and submitted as a
facsimile job to "user" at the specified "dest".  By writing a more
involved mailfax script you can add things like different resolutions
by parsing the "user" string.  For example, an X.400-style scheme might
use:

    user/R=low/N=done@host.fax

where "R=low" specifies a low res facsimile and "N=done" requests
notification when the job is done.  If you want symbolic destinations,
then you can provide a host to phone number mapping facility.


NOTE: The normal access control mechansims on submitting a facsimile
for transmission are enforced--you may need to use them if you create
an email to fax gateway on your machine!


Dirk Husemann's more elaborate scheme is also included in the directory
../contrib/dirk.
