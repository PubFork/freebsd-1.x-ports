ModemMaxRate:		19200		# max rate for DCE-DTE communication
#GettyArgs:		"-h %l dx_%s"	# requires modem to auto-detect fax/data
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	S13=1&D2	# setup so DTR drop resets modem

# We normally append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# NB: If you need to prefix phone numbers to get through a PBX,
#     put it in the ModemDialCmd; e.g. "DT9%s@".
#
ModemDialCmd:		DT%s@		# T for tone dialing, @ for silence
