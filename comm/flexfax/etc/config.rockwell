# Configuration for a Rockwell-based Class 2 modem.
#    Boca M1440E		firmware V1.270 or newer
#    Dallas Fax			(throw it away!)
#    Hayes Optima 24+Fax96	firmware TR00-J260-001 XXX or newer
#    SupraFAX v.32bis		firmware V1.200-C or newer
#    Twincom 144/DF		firmware revision V1.200 or newer
# (and others)
#
# This configuration file sets up the modem to run at 19.2 for
# sending and for receiving.  XON/XOFF flow control is used on
# the tty port.  RTS/CTS can be used by switching the flow control
# setup, but beware of modems that do not support it during
# facsimile operations.  Also beware that the adaptive-answer
# facility, when supported, is usually unreliable.
