Our environment is very similar to yours. I thought about installing the
flexfax software as a package on one of our file servers, that way users could
be using all the flexfax tools (sendfax, faxrm, faxstat, faxalter, ...), yet
the unavailability of gcc 2.3.3 on our Sun Sparc machines (and the red tape to
go thru to get that installed) caused me to re-think. Now we have the
following setup:

        - The faxd (in fact serveral of them, with one on a dedicated line) is
          running on i486 machine under BSDi's BSD/386. That machine is known
          as the i4fax server.

        - Users on BSD/386 machines can (if they want to) use the flexfax
          tools for submitting facsimiles.

        - All other users can send mail to fax-number@i4fax, where fax-number
          is something like
                fax-phone-number[.fax-to[.fax-company[.fax-location]]]@i4fax

          like
                +49-9131-85-8732.Husemann.Uni-Erlangen.Germany@i4fax
          or alternatively use X-fax headers (which give more flexibility) 
                X-Fax-To: Dirk  Husemann
                X-Fax-Company: University of Erlangen Nuremberg
                X-Fax-Location: Erlangen, Germany
                X-Fax-Transmit-Time: 22:00

        - on the i4fax server all the mail arriving for i4fax is fed into a
          perl script (faxmailer) that will look at the mail, extract all the
          relevant fields and also the senders name and address and pipe all
          into sendfax.

        - Optionally the users can specify ``X-Fax-Report: do'' and get back
          the status of the queue as soon as the job has been queued.

        - Upon receipt of a facsimile a modified notify script (also in perl)
          takes the TIFF file, converts it to PostScript (for the time being
          at least) and sends the PostScript file as a MIME mail along with
          the information about who called, how many pages, etc. to the
          FaxMaster. The FaxMaster gets the MIME mail, views it with
          Ghostview, decides whom to forward the MIME mail and does
          accordingly (still as MIME mail).

          Currently we're using PostScript for one reason --- the ghostview
          user agent is quite comfortable: the user can page thru a recieved
          facsimile backwards and forwards, she can print it with a key press,
          mark specific pages for saving or printing, etc. If we were to do
          OCR on the facsimile we'd probably be better of using the TIFF file
          instead (and sent it instead/additionally in the MIME mail).

If anyone is interested I'll mail the two perl scripts (faxmailer and the
modified notify).

        Dirk
