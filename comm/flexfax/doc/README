fax.ps is a paper about an older version of this system.
The paper appeared in the proceedings of the European
Unix User's Group conference held in Nice, France in 1990.
(It also appeared in the Australian Unix User's Group
conference held in Melbourne in 1990.)  While the paper
is out of date, it gives background information and some
useful references.
