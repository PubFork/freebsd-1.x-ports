This is a reasonably full-function facsimile service for UNIX systems.
Facsimile can be sent from any machine on a network and received
facsimile are stored in a receiving area and may be automatically
delivered by mail and/or printed.  The system also supports the sharing
of modems by data communication applications that honor the "uucp
locking protocol".  These applications typically include cu, uucp, and
slip.  When possible, the system automatically invokes the getty
program for incoming data communication calls.

Operationally, one facsimile server process exists for each fax modem
hooked to a serial port.  Client software spools outgoing facsimile
that are handled by the server processes.  Received facsimile are
stored in a receive queue area and may be automatically delivered by
mail and/or printed.  Servers are heavily parameterized through
per-server configuration files and through auxiliary shell scripts that
do system-related operations (e.g. processing received facsimile,
converting PostScript to bitmap images for transmission).

The server requires a PostScript to facsimile imaging utility for
useful operation (otherwise, only pre-imaged facsimile may be
transmitted.)  A Display PostScript-based imager is provided for IRIX
4.x-based systems.  For other systems, a Ghostscript-based version can
be built from the GNU sources and the files in the gs and libtiff
directories.
