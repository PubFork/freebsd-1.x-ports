This directory holds a fax device driver for version 2.52 of
Ghostscript.  If you want to use Ghostscript to convert PostScript to
facsimile in the server, you should configure the tiffg3 device into
your copy of Ghostscript.  gdevtiff.c is the device driver.  devs.mak
is the makefile rules for the device drivers; updated to include the
rules for the tiffg3 device.  You will also need to copy or link the
file ../libtiff/tiff.h to the Ghostscript directory, or modify the
Makefile to search for it in the apppropriate location.

Note that if you use Ghostscript to image, you must setup the symbolic
link bin/ps2fax in the spooling area to point to bin/ps2fax.gs.  This
is usually done during the software configuration process (i.e. when
the configure script is run).

The files included in this directory:

Makefile.sgi	Ghostscript makefile for SGI machines (configured w/ tiff*)
gdevtiff.c	TIFF G3-encoded image device driver
devs.mak	makefile rules for device drivers including gdevtiff.c

PS. The Ghostscript driver does not support 2D encoding.  This is known
    by the ps2fax.gs.sh script that invokes it (it strips out the 1-D/2-D
    options supplied by the fax server).
