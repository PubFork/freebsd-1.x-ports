The FreeBSD port is basically the same as the 386BSD port. But as
FreeBSD comes with updated binaries and gcc there are a few changes.
The only programs that need replacement in FreeBSd is expr, use GNU
expr and make, again use GNU make.

Here's some of tricks to get it running
----------------------------------------

The only make that works with the makefiles is GNU make-3.63 or newer,
with standard /usr/bin/make (from distribution) you will get nowhere.
Also with GNU make-3.62 you will have problems with incdepend
targets.

The distribution expr does not handle the faxaddmodem script, replace
with expr from GNU shellutils.

The distribution sed does not handle the faxaddmodem script, replace
/usr/bin/sed with GNU sed.

The kernel needs to be recompiled with "options FIFO" in the config
file. Before running config on your new config file you have to
remove fifo.h and all *.o files in your compile directory, the cause
of the troubles is not known in detail... 

I have successfully sent and received faxes with my Supra FAXmodem
v32bis.
