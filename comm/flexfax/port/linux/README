Sending faxes works fine.  I've received faxes using faxanswer,
but since the phone line is my voice line, I haven't tried out
the autoanswer mode, or the getty startup code.

Some notes:
	- the kernel needs a small bug fix.  See the file
	  kernel.patch for details.  From the directory in which
	  this file resides, do the following:
		(cd /linux ; patch -p0) < kernel.patch
	  This fix is needed for versions <= 99p10.
	- `at' is not installed on my system, so I have not
	  tested things like queuing a job for later sending
	  or specifying a killtime.

I successfully built this with make 3.62, gcc 2.3.3, 99p9.

Compiling the tiff library takes a long time.  Make sure you have
at least 15Mb free (RAM + swap).

Problems to pclink@qus102.qld.tne.oz.au.

Rick.
