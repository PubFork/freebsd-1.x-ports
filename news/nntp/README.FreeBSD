DBZ, the standard news database,  is not part of the nntp distribution,
but has been included here from the C News package distributed with
FreeBSD.

If you intend to use NNTP with C News, then the configuration in
./common/conf.h should be pretty close.  If you don't want to use
C News or the DBZ data base, then edit ./Makefile and ./common/conf.h
accordingly.
