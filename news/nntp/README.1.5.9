Welcome to patch number 9 for NNTP 1.5.

	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:

	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3
	send public nntp.patch.4.shar
	send public nntp.patch.5.shar
	send public nntp.patch.6.shar
	send public nntp.patch.7.shar
	send public nntp.patch.8.pt1.shar

Please read the CHANGES file (following application of the patch) for
a list of new features/bug fixes. This release contains the initial 
version of the proposed NNTP V2 authentication feature. Please be sure that
your read the file AUTHORIZE if you want to use it. The meaning of the verbs
in the nntp access file have been altered slightly. Be sure to read the revised
nntpd man page for more information.

Bug reports and enhancements welcome,

P.S. This patched version of NNTP has been compiled on the following systems:

Vax 3600 running Ultrix 3.1 (BNEWS 2.11.19)
Solbourne Series 5/601 with OS/MP 4.0C (SunOS 4.0.3c compatible) (Same BNEWS)
HP 9000/825 running HP-UX A.B3.00.5B

P.P.S. The fully patched version is available via anonymous ftp from
lib.tmc.edu [129.106.5.1]. Look in the public directory for nntp.1.5.9.tar.
A compressed version is also on line.

P.P.P.S. There will most likely be a release 1.5.10 before we get to 1.6.
