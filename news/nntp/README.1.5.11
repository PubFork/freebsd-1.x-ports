Welcome to patch number 11 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first ten patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1
	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3
	send public nntp.patch.4.shar
	send public nntp.patch.5.shar
	send public nntp.patch.6.shar
	send public nntp.patch.7.shar
	send public nntp.patch.8.pt1.shar
	send public nntp.patch.8.pt2.shar
	send public nntp.patch.9.pt1.shar
	send public nntp.patch.9.pt2.shar
	send public nntp.patch.9.pt3.shar
	send public nntp.patch.10.pt1.shar
	send public nntp.patch.10.pt2.shar

	If you have all ten patches installed, you are ready to install
	this set of patches. These patches are packaged as four shell archives.
	Be sure to unpack the shars in the root of your nntp distribution.
	They are as follows: 
	CHANGES.diff  -- This will patch the CHANGES file in the root
	of the nntp distrbution to reflect changes since the release of 1.5.

	in the server subdirectory. New versions of README and conf.h.dist
	will be created in the common subdirectory. A new version of
	access_file will be created in the support subdirectory.

P.S. This patched version of NNTP has been compiled on the following systems:

Vax 3600 running Ultrix 3.1 (BNEWS 2.11.19)
Solbourne Series 5/601 with OS/MP 4.0D (SunOS 4.0.3c compatible) (Same BNEWS)
HP 9000/825 running HP-UX A.B3.00.5B

P.P.S. The fully patched version is available via anonymous ftp from
lib.tmc.edu [129.106.5.1] and gazette.bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.2]. Look in
the public directory for nntp.1.5.11.tar. A compressed version is also on line.

P.P.P.S. This is the really FINAL release of NNTP 1.5. The next release will
be 1.6. There will be no patch kit. NNTP 1.6 will be a full release and
will only be distributed in full source.
