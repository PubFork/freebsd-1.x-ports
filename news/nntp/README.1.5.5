Welcome to patch number 5 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first four patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1
	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3
	send public nntp.patch.4.shar

	If you have all four patches installed, you are ready to install
	this set of patches. These patches are packaged as a shell archive.
	They are as follows:

	of the nntp distrbution to reflect changes since the release of 1.5.
