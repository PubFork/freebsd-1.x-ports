Welcome to patch number 4 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first three patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1
	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3

	If you have all three patches installed, you are ready to install
	this set of patches. These patches are packaged as a shell archive.
	They are as follows:
	CHANGES.diff  -- This will patch the CHANGES file in the root
	of the nntp distrbution to reflect changes since the release of 1.5.
	server.diff -- This patch is for the files in the server subdirectory.
	To install, change directory to the server directory and type
	patch < server.diff.
	common.diff -- This patch is for the files in the common sub-
	directory. To install, change directory to the common directory
	and type patch < common.diff
	doc.diff -- This patch is for the files in the doc subdirectory.
	To install, change directory to the doc directory and type
	patch < doc.diff.
	xmit.diff -- This is a patch for nntpxmit.c in the xmit directory.
	To install, change directory to the xmit directory and type
	patch < xmit.diff.
	inews.diff -- This patch is for the files in the inews subdirectory.
	To install, change directory to the inews directory and type
	patch < inews.diff.
	support.diff -- This patch is for the files in the support sub-
	directory. To install, change directory to the support directory
	and type patch < support.diff.
	
	Now, look at common/conf.h and common/README for the new functions
	you may want to use (DOMAINMATCH, HIDDENNET, etc.).

	If you don't need HIDDENNET, you only need to rebuild nntpxmit and
	nntpd. If you need HIDDENNET, you will have to rebuild inews and
	reinstall it on all the nntp clients (NOT the server!).

Please read the CHANGES file (following application of the patch) for
a list of new features.

Some specific comments:

	TMNN support: The LIST command has been extended to provide some
	initial support to TMNN (someday to be News 3.0). These extensions
	are:
	LIST ACTIVE --- Lists the news active file. Just like LIST with no
		arguements.
	LIST DISTRIBUTIONS -- List the news distributions file.
	LIST NEWSGROUPS -- List the news group discriptions file.

	out-of-space support: BSD, SunOS, Ultrix, and System V are supported.
	If NNTP knows that there is no space when an xfer-only system connects
	it will greet that client with a 503 message. Clients listed in
	nntp_access with read enabled will be greeted normally. If
	the server runs out of space following a transfer, when the
	client enters the next IHAVE, the server will respond with 436
	and close the connection. nntpxmit will requeue when this
	happens. Posting will be rejected similiarly unless you have
	some value greater than zero set for the POST_BUFFER. See
	post.c for the nitty gritty.

Bug reports and enhancements welcome,
Stan Barber

P.S. I expect Phil will take the reins back following this patch.
