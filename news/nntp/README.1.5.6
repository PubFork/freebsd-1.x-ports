Welcome to patch number 6 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first five patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1
	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3
	send public nntp.patch.4.shar
	send public nntp.patch.5.shar

	If you have all five patches installed, you are ready to install
	this set of patches. These patches are packaged as a shell archive.
	They are as follows:
	CHANGES.diff  -- This will patch the CHANGES file in the root
	of the nntp distrbution to reflect changes since the release of 1.5.
	server.diff -- This patch is for the files in the server subdirectory.
	To install, change directory to the server directory and type
	patch < server.diff.
	common.diff -- This patch is for the files in the common sub-
	directory. To install, change directory to the common directory
	and type patch < common.diff
	xmit.diff -- This is a patch for nntpxmit.c in the xmit directory.
	To install, change directory to the xmit directory and type
	patch < xmit.diff.
	inews.diff -- This patch is for the files in the inews subdirectory.
	To install, change directory to the inews directory and type
	patch < inews.diff.
	
	Now, look at common/conf.h.dist and common/README for the new functions
	you may want to use (BATCHED_INPUT,CNEWS). You may want to use the 
	new conf.h.dist file as your conf.h file and make changes to it based
	on your old conf.h file.

	NOTE: You need to look this over for the following items:
	SIGRET, LOAD, and all the stuff that relates to CNEWS if you run it.

Please read the CHANGES file (following application of the patch) for
a list of new features.

Bug reports and enhancements welcome,
