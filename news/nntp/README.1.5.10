Welcome to patch number 10 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first nine patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1
	send public nntp.patch.2
	send public nntp.patch.3
	send public nntp.patch.4.shar
	send public nntp.patch.5.shar
	send public nntp.patch.6.shar
	send public nntp.patch.7.shar

	send public nntp.patch.9.pt1.shar
	send public nntp.patch.9.pt2.shar
	send public nntp.patch.9.pt3.shar

P.P.S. The fully patched version is available via anonymous ftp from
lib.tmc.edu [129.106.5.1] and gazette.bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.2]. Look in
