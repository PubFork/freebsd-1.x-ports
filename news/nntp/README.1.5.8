Welcome to patch number 8 for NNTP 1.5.

	If you have not installed the first seven patches, you must do so
	before proceeding. You can get those patches (and this one) from
	anoymous ftp on bcm.tmc.edu [128.249.2.1] or by sending a message
	to the archive-server@bcm.tmc.edu with the following text:
	send public nntp.patch.1

P.S. This patched version of NNTP has been compiled on the following systems:

Vax 3600 running Ultrix 3.1 (BNEWS 2.11.19)
Solbourne Series 5/601 with OS/MP 4.0C (SunOS 4.0.3c compatible) (Same BNEWS)
HP 9000/825 running HP-UX A.B3.00.5B
Wyse-386 running SCO XENIX 2.3 with TCP/IP 1.0
VAX 11/780 running BSD 4.3-tahoe
Silicon Graphics IRIS-4D running IRIX 3.2.1

P.P.S. The fully patched version is available via anonymous ftp from
lib.tmc.edu [129.106.5.1]. Look in the public directory for nntp.1.5.8.tar.
A compressed version is also on line.

P.P.P.S. The next version of nntp is supposed to be 1.6. This version will have
a new way of configuring everything based on Larry Wall's meta-configure. It
may have bug fixes and enhancements as well. There has been alot of chatter
about authentication. I am going to look into that, but no promises at this
time.
