Hiya.

Please can you move slurp-1.07.tar.Z from incoming into pub/news/slurp.
Announcement thingie follows below.

Cheers,
Steve.


Slurp is an advanced passive NNTP client for UNIX. It will connect to a
remote NNTP server and retrieve articles in a specified set of Usenet
newsgroups that have arrived after a particular date (typically the
last time it was invoked) for processing by your local news system. It
replaces nntpxfer from the NNTP 1.5.11 reference implementation and
nntpget from the INN distribution.

Slurp was written in ANSI C under Dell's SVR4/386, but ports easily to
SunOs 4.x, Linux, BSDI BSD/386, HPUX, NeXT, SCO, ISC, Ultrix and most
other recent versions of UNIX.

If you are running a previous version of Slurp it is *strongly*
recommended that you upgrade to this new version.


New features:-

    Improved support for machines with filesystems that don't have long
    filenames.

    No longer needs to be running on the same machine as news, so you
    can, for example, collect news on a machine with an Internet
    connection which isn't running news and send it out over UUCP to a
    remote machine which is.


Main bug fixes:-

    Yay! Found it at last! Slurp now works properly on SVR3 machines
    without stdio collapsing in a heap of memory errors. This might
    have affected some other architectures too but they didn't behave
    quite so badly.

    Under some circumstances, Slurp would fail to parse a list of
    newsgroups properly into a series of NEWNEWS commands. This is now
    fixed.

    Fixed problem where if Slurp was interrupted before the NEWNEWS
    section had completed, an invalid time would be written to the
    slurp.<hostname> file.

    The usual bits of tidying up to make the Keep C Source Tidy
    Campaign happy.
