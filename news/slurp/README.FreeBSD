DBZ is not part of the Slurp distribution, but has been included from the
FreeBSD C News distribution.

The only change to make slurp compile under FreeBSD was to add a 386BSD
ifdef to space.c.  (And to change the Makefile to build  dbz/dbz.o)

After editting ./conf.h, typing `make' should build slurp.
The file `README' contains further instructions.
