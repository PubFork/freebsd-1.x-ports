.SH NAME
newsetup - a program to set up a .newsrc file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newsetup
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I newsetup
program creates a new .newsrc file containing all of the currently active
newsgroups.
It tries to put them in a reasonable order, i.e. local newsgroups earlier,
but you'll probably want to change the ordering anyway (if you use
.IR rn )
in order to put interesting newsgroups first.
If you already have a .newsrc, it will be backed up with the name
\*(L".oldnewsrc\*(R".
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DOTDIR 8
Where to put your .newsrc, if not in your home directory.
.Sp
Default: $HOME
.IP HOME 8
Your home directory.
.Sp
Default: $LOGDIR
.IP LOGDIR 8
Your home directory if HOME is undefined.
.SH FILES
/usr/lib/news/active or a reasonable facsimile
.br
${DOTDIR-{$HOME-$LOGDIR}}/.newsrc
