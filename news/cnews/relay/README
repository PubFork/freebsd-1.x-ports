This is relaynews, the heart of C News:  article filing.

If you're starting here, you are in the wrong place:  go to ../conf and
run "build".

Subdirectories are:

ads	some silliness
anews	stuff for conversion to and from the old A News format
aux	auxiliary programs of various kinds
ctl	control-message shell files
altctl	alternative, not recommended, versions of rmgroup and sendgroups
sh	shell files, including inews and its flunkies
regress	regression-test facilities for relaynews

ihave.not.c is an alternate version of ihave.c for sites that specifically
wish to disable ihave/sendme (typically because of foolishness like
proprietary newsgroups).

To run a regression test, "make r".
