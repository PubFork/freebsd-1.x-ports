This is C News master configuration stuff, including some auxiliary C News
programs that are quite likely to need site-specific customizing, and some
odds and ends of maintenance stuff that didn't fit anywhere else.

Subst may possibly be useful enough to deserve installation as a program
in its own right, which is why a manual page is supplied.

"build" is the all-singing-all-dancing interactive shell program that sets
up a bunch of shell files for you to run to install everything.  "build"
itself does not mess with anything, so it can be run without danger.
