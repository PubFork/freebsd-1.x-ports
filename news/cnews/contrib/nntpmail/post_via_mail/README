This directory contains C news support for posting news to a remote
server by mailing the article to a special alias.

frontend_inews	parse options, masquerades news headers so they can
		go through mail, mail the article to the remote
		alias.  Install as $NEWSLIB/inews

server_inews	The special alias on the news server should invke this
		e.g.
		feednews: "|/usr/lib/newsbin/server_inews"

		Make sure the nntp server invokes server_inews and
		not fake_inews (instant infinite loop!).

		You can find this file in ../nntp_support

usenet		a version of ../mail_to_newsgroup/usenet that works
		by remailing the article.
