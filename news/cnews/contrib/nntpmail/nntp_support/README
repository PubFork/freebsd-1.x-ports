This directory contains C news support for posting news via NNTP.

frontend_inews	parse options, invokes $NEWSBIN/nntp/inews to
		send the article to the remote NNTP server.

$NEWSBIN/nntp/inews
		not included here, you can get the NNTP distribution
		from UCSD.EDU and apply the patches found on
		bcm.tmc.edu.  This is the C program that sends	
		the article to a remote server

server_inews	if you run an NNTP server, it should call this as its
		inews (fix common/conf.h).  figures out moderated newsgroups
		and all that.

	        To repeat: make sure the nntp server invokes server_inews and
		not $NEWSBIN/nnpt/news (instant infinite loop!).
