POSTING VIA MAIL

We wanted our users to be able to mail to the newsgroups, so we wrote a
sendmail/zmailer transport agent to support this.  You must edit your
mailer configuration file so that mail to a newsgroup gets sent to that
user agent.  The default router.cf distributed with zmailer does that.

usenet:	      sendmail-compatible transport agent.  Our mailer invokes it on 
              local names it can find in the active newsgroup file, so the 
	      message gets posted.  usenet then arranges for a real inews
	      to get invoked by either
	      a) calling inews itself
	      b) pushing the message with NNTP to a news server
	         (see ../nntp_support)
	      c) remailing the message to a news server
	         (inferior to b, but it can be made to work. see
		 ../fake_nntp_via_mail)

Posting via mail ensures proper return addresses and automagically supports
whatever fancy processing the mailer does (hiding workstation names, producing
Full.Name@do.ma.in forms, whatever), In fact, we changed our set-up to use a
fake inews that mails the article to the newsgroups.

frontend_inews
	      This fake inews parses the arguments and mails to the list
	      of newsgroups so that the From: and other headers get generated
	      by a program that really knows what it is doing.  The mailer
	      will then arrange for injection in the news flow.

	      This inews gets invoked by Pnews et al.  It would traditionally
	      go in /usr/lib/news/inews.  Make sure that it does not get
	      invoked by NNTP on a news server, for that would cause a nice
	      infinite loop.
